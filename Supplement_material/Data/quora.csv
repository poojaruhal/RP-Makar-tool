In this scheme, a copy of the source code and the build/installation instructions of all commercially sold software should be retained by a responsible third party. In the event that the original company goes out of business or ceases to maintain it for a reasonable amount of time (say 5 years) - then the third party automatically releases it as OpenSource.Code for things that are on the exposed edges of networks should have to be vetted by 3rd party security companies before being released into products that connect to network infrastructure.Obviously, the devil is in the details here. Who makes sure this happens? Who are the responsible 3rd parties? Who guards the guardians?This is an ideal - I doubt that it’s in any way practical. ## Of course not. Having closed source is useful because it gives a way for those who are doing the work to reap the rewards for the thousands of man-hours it took to create that source code in the first place.You don’t NEED to see the stuff I write. You can either buy the product, or not.BTW, what “security” are you talking about when it comes to a washing machine? The code to run a washing machine is essentially a bunch of timer routines which turn things on and off. In fact, you could build all of that without an embedded controller and just use a bunch of logic gates and timing ICs (the board would of course be larger). ## No, I don’t think so. I think there is a lot more code around than you think, that a lot of it doesn’t need to be open source. Why does the code of a simple toaster or a car window controller need to be open?I agree we need to pay a lot more attention to things with internet connections. But devices with no connection to the net have no need for it. And even then, I think that audited internet and encryption stacks would be better than blanket open source. ## Having code being open source doesn’t solve the security and transparency issue… it makes it harder to deal with because you can’t point out to source of failure or where the hack took place.Code escrow doesn’t solve the problem eiither. What happens if the third-party gets hacked? how many products would such a hack affect?I agree that there should be code audits or guidelines for networked software auditing, particularly if it’s open source, but the process and guidelines themselves should not be open source but managed by a non-profit that can provide ongoing support and vendor independence… similar to what OWASP does for security best practices."

A talented developer who determines they have no choice but to create faster code than the compiler can produce in certain circumstances.This article C Is Not a Low-level Language gives a good explanation of some limitations of C that makes it hard for a compiler to produce optimised code for modern hardware.Fortunately this level of optimisation isn’t something that needs to be done by a human very often as the code the compiler creates is usually sufficient.Instead optimisation is typically addressed first by profiling and addressing the design bottenecks, e.g. selecting a more appropriate data structure or algorithm, or addressing the impact of I/O latency, or use of concurrency/parallelism.This is lucky as hand writing modern machine code that outperforms a compiler is non-trivial and going to take a long time to get correct. ## Compiler(assembler more specifically) converts C program into machine code.That’s why you hear a term like “toolchain” & “cross-compile” in embedded(although it is not needed in native-compilation).

"/What-is-your-take-on-Robert-C-Martins-opinion-on-comments-The-code-itself-is-the-best-comment"," Code Comments,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming,  Survey Question","What is your take on Robert C. Martin's opinion on comments: ""The code itself is the best comment""?","I very much agree with Uncle Bob’s attitude in regards to comments. Your code really shouldn’t need them. And if you go around scattering them everywhere, there’s a big chance they will end up being out of date and thus actually telling you lies, making the code even less understandable.Also see Alan Mellor's answer for a very good explanation on this.And also don’t forget that this way of thinking also actually serves another really important thing in regards to comments: if you follow this logic, then when there are comments there, you’ll actually be reading them, because they are so few that they must be there to really show something that is important, that you otherwise wouldn’t get from the code it self.<I really love deleting whole blocks of comments and Javadoc which say nothing else then exactly what the code below it is doing./*** This method calculates the average of the values that are inserted**@Param values*	 a list of doubles which represent the values of which the average will be calculated*@Return*	a double which represents the average of the values that are inserted*@Throws EmptyListException *	will be thrown when you try to calculate the average of the values when the values is an empty list**/private double calculateAverage(List<Double> values) throws EmptyListException {	.... implementation}Honestly, I don’t need 10 lines of Javadoc telling me what I can clearly see from the method signature. (Javadoc written from very sketchy memory, so probably very incorrect, when I do write it, I usually leave it to my IDE to generate the basic set up and just fill in the blanks)Doesn’t this look much nicer?private double calculateAverage(List<Double> values) throws EmptyListException {	.... implementation}If you do this, then the methods where you are adding Javadoc, that Javadoc must really contain some interesting information, and thus there you read it. While if all methods contain those 10 lines, you’ll also just skip over the methods where there is actually something useful happening.>Personally that is very much the style I follow. Try to write the code in such a way that it is directly clear what is going on. But if there really is some obscure voodoo happening which I can’t prevent for one reason or another, I’ll add a comment to explain why it is the way it (which might even be an honest “I really couldn’t figure out a nicer way to do this, if you do, be my guest”).Other comments that I tend to include, in either the production or test code, is references to certain bug reports or user stories (in case it is a less obvious feature / piece of logic). So if you are wondering why the hell that weird if-statement is where it is, you can quickly find out the reason behind it (without having to look through 10 years of commits, which might even be harder to trace back (in GIT) in case a file was renamed or move to another package). This will allow you to more easily decide what to do with it in case it (appears to conflict) with other changes you are making later down the road. Maybe the “solution” was a bit too “kort door de bocht” (as we would say in Dutch: taking the corner a bit too tightly) and thus it may appear conflict with the new requirement, but actually the new requirement and the old one allow you to create a more generalized requirement which is more correct.We also follow a testing strategy for user stories where another developer than the one building the user story will write a test specification for the user story. This will include both tests to be executed manually (again by somebody else than the one building) and those that should be implemented in automated tests (generally preferably integration tests, but somethings one (or a combination of) unit test(s) might also suffice). Then the implementations of these automated tests are also code reviewed to ensure they do indeed match the test spec and they are actually testing what they are purporting they are testing. These tests we also annotated with the test case number (which contains the user story number).All this leads to the advantage that if some test breaks down the line, you will be able to more easily retrace (in case this isn’t immediately obvious) what was actually the intended functionality that the test was covering and also to help you figure out if the fact that the test now fails is because the requirements have changed (and thus the expectation in the test should change) or that you actually did break something.TL;DR; I do indeed agree with Uncle Bob’s take on comments that comments should only be used for things that aren’t immediately clear from the code (and in those cases that generally means a failure on your part of being able to write the code in such a way that it is clear).Next to that I also prefer to follow the attitude in regards to comments of commenting the “why” of what is happening instead of what is actually happening, as that should be clear from the code. And in this “why” I include references to places that contain a more details specification of this, such as bug reports and user story specifications. ## Robert Martin is a consultant. Consultants get paid a lot of money when projects go horribly awry and management panics. Consultants do not get hired when projects are running smoothly. Do you really want to trust the advice from someone whose livelihood depends on you screwing up?Being an Agile Manifestoid (a warning sign if there ever is one) he really should say, “The test of the code is the best comment,” and with that I would be more generous; but having spent the last three days reverse-engineering a rather odious piece of uncommented code, my generosity is exhausted. Even the associated unit test is obfuscated and offers little help in explaining what the developer was trying to accomplish.Nobody thinks exactly like you: it’s pure egotism to even think that they might. Code describes process, not intent. Comments should describe intent. ## In general, yes. The code should tell you everything you need to know about what's going on.Unfortunately, that's not always the case. The code surely, without a doubt tells you how it works, but it doesn't tell you why it works the way it does.Sometimes you're rushed and need to get something out quick. This usual leads to poor, or at least inefficient, design. Maybe you plan on going back to fix it. Maybe not. Either way, you should at least be courteous and write some comments around some of the more obscure bits of code.Sometimes you write something and it might not at all be clear why it's even needed. I find this happens most often when integrating with third-party libraries or frameworks.For example, I recently integrated some code at work with a popular vendor's cloud service. Luckily, they provide a library for the language and framework I was using that basically “integrated” for me. Well, turns out they didn't account for every use case in the framework, ironically one that involves using a core cloud service of the framework. To get around this I had to write a bunch of code to essentially fix the order of things getting executed.For anyone else coming in and reading this, I knew it wouldn't be immediately obvious why I wrote this since it shouldn't need to be there. Because of that, I wrote out a few comments about why this code was needed.The point is, your intent should always be clear, either by the code or though comments. After you write code, you should always step back and ask yourself: “Is this clear to someone without my insight?” If not, try rewriting it. If that's not an option, add comments.Try to avoid commenting about libraries, frameworks, or common design patterns. There should be documentation out there for that. ## Pragmatically, he is right.The code is the only up to date, reliable documentation we have. That, and on a good day, some unit tests that actually help clarify intent.There are surely better ways to describe code and how it works than code. Diagrams, tutorial videos, reams of design specs, how-tos, JIRA tickets and who knows what else.But who even reads them? Where do they live, given that they aren’t in GitHub?Can you trust them? Will you update them?Me neither, if I’m honest with you.I like to aim for readable, self-describing code, and have to live with the failures. You can’t really do that, fully. But you can’t really do the other stuff, either.So we’re stuck with the code being what it is. At least that’s the thing telling the computer what to do, so it’s accurate - even if very hard to understand. ## I agree. But it’s more complex than that.The code itself is “the best comment” in the sense that it should be written to be self-explanatory, and ideally shouldn’t require other comments. Comments are problematic because their content can’t be subjected to the same rigorous testing process as code. If they’re out of date or outright incorrect, you won’t know until you read the code - and even then, you could be misled into believing the comments are still relevant.Comments in clear code are an anti-pattern, just like duplicate code or extraneous variables. They purport to serve a function but are actually redundant at best.However, comments are necessary if there’s no other way to explain what code does without referencing something far-flung and non-obvious. Before you write a comment explaining code, I really believe you should think about whether there is another way. Can you rename a variable or a method? Can you clean up the logic within a reasonable time frame? Might you even want to add a TODO task to clean up the code so the comment is no longer necessary? ## Consider the following example:x=4; /* Set x to 4 */The comment in the above code is absolutely worthless. To figure out that x is being set to 4, the code itself tells you that.Here’s another example:x=4; /* Set the maximum number of loop iterations to 4 */The comment adds something in this case (by describing what x is), but look at what happens if you use a more meaningful variable name:Max_Loop_Iterations = 4;The point is, that you should be able to figure out what the code is doing by reading the code itself, and using good coding techniques can do that.Let me emphasize, though, that using good techniques does not eliminate the need for commentary in the code. Reading the code itself is the best way to get the “what”, but comments are still important to describe the “why”. For example, if there’s a non-obvious reason why you’re limiting the number of iterations to 4, use a comment to describe that.Max_Loop_Iterations = 4; /* Set a limit on the number of iterations because… 4 is a good choice because… */ ## Generally, I would agree.However, I recently started at a new company with a fairly sizable codebase. Some of the React classes I am seeing are generally readable, but there are some that have a lot of code sort of split out between many different sections, so it becomes the game of “oh this calls this. and now this. where is this defined? oh here in this other thing. Okay, but now where is this set?” A couple of comments here and there would likely help someone understand, especially for these larger components. Playing the “hunt down everything” game isn’t hard, but it is definitely time consuming (for a particularly complex class I spent the better part of a day and a half tracking things down). ## True to an extent. Well named variables following obvious logical steps let you know what the person who wrote the code (possibly past-you, that lazy bastard) was thinking when they wrote it.However if you only have a vague idea what the code is supposed to do in the first place, you can very quickly become baffled, especially if it uses terminology and abbreviations outside of your field of expertise.Commenting every variable to just restate the variable name as it’s purpose is bad. Commenting nothing and leaving everyone to sort it out in the future is bad. A happy medium between the two is ideal. ## I’m going to disagree with Mr. Martin’s opinion, and with most of the folks answering this question. Mr. Martin has perhaps not spent 41 years trying to fathom and fix other folks’ code. I have, and I can tell you, comments help a lot, especially with weird spaghetti code and “trickery”. Yes, once or twice in my career I was tripped up by a wrong comment, but far more commonly, perhaps 90% of the time, there are no comments whatsoever, and the code, such as it is, is not enlightening at all.Comments are a very useful tool; not using them is like using a screwdriver for a hammer. Yes, it will work, sort of, but why not use the tools that you have?The answer, I fear, is that good commenting practice is not taught, not encouraged, and not rewarded. ## I’m a big fan of Uncle Bob, so this is nothing personal…Like most pithy quips, it’s kinda, sorta right, sometimes.Yes, well written and formatted code is easier to read than crappy code. Well-named variables and classes will help make clear what’s going on.But, no, that’s not all the next developer needs.Even if we believed that it were possible to write code so that what it does is instantly, intuitively obvious (it’s not), that doesn’t explain why it does what it does in the way that it does.Programming is more thinking than typing, and still, more code is written, test, rejected, and deleted than is left in the finished* product.That means that the next nerd will have no idea that you were coding around external limitations (database engines, external APIs, disk space, etc.) or less-visible business rules — unless you tell her.* Just go along with me on the fiction that any software product is ever really finished. If it makes you feel better, substitute “left alone for a while.” ## My take on Robert C. Martin's opinions in general is that they are ideals. They are worth striving towards but many other things must be considered.It is true that many comments can be replaced with better code. Instead of explaining why you named a variable a single letter, give it the damn word.But there are certain things that need comments. With good code you should not need to explain what you're doing, but it won't explain why you're doing it.Various trade-offs must be taken into account when programming. The code cannot explain why certain trade-offs have been chosen. That is what comments are for. ## I think it's a big pile of horse-droppings!It's arrogant to think that the only people who will ever view and investigate that code will be coders of the same skill level and/or experience with the language and/or systems. I'm no coder and I certainly wouldn't call myself a developer, yet I have picked up enough over the years to be able to make a reasonable amount of adjustments where necessary. Even to build a few fairly simple systems, primarily for my own use.Well commented code and the selfless help of strangers on various help forums allowed me to do that.Refusing to comment your code strikes me as a bit like saying “If you can't follow this then you're not as good as me. And I won't stoop to help you”. ## It is absolutely correct but it is only half the story.Bad comments are very, very easy to write.max_retry = 4; // cap the number of transmissions at 5Is that an out-of-date comment? You’d have to check the code to be sure.There’s an old saw that states, a man with one watch always knows what time it is but a man with two is never sure. The comments should never say anything that can be expressed in code and, if it can be expressed clearly in code, then it should be. The code is always right; anything else is a bug and can be tested for. Nobody ever tests the comments.Comments should say stuff that the code cannot but, more than that, it should be written with a different mind-set. Most of the time we are writing comments for the programmer who is to come after us. They need to know why we wrote the code this way and what pit-falls to look out for. They don’t need us to hold their hand and point out the obvious.If the code is written well then comments should serve one of two purposes:To apologise for and explain non-obvious code that is required for valid reasons. For example a convoluted if statement that, if it were simplified, would lead to code duplication.To document.Sometimes the code is not available.This documentation was produced from code comments. What is the return value from the second method? A look at the code shows why it isn’t specified.long wxListCtrl::InsertItem(long index, const wxString& label){    wxListItem info;    info.m_text = label;    info.m_mask = wxLIST_MASK_TEXT;    info.m_itemId = index;    return InsertItem(info);}It returns the same thing as the first method. To be fair, one could guess that, but than one has to jump around in the documentation guessing and sometimes guessing wrongly. But putting it in the comment runs the risk that the first method could change and invisibly obsolete the documentation of the second method.If comments are written to document and may be read in an external document, then they must be complete and written from the point of view of someone reading the external document. That could be a maintainer or someone trying to use an API. Those are different people and they need to read different things. A maintainer needs an overview before they dive in and look at the code. They need to know all of the non-obvious interrelationships between objects. API Class and method comments must allow someone to use them without reading the code. They should duplicate information that is obvious in the code. They should reference information elsewhere that a maintainer may be expected to know. They should list pit-falls and limitations that are obvious or of no interest to a maintainer. Auto-generated API documentation is a huge leap forward over separate, hand-written, documents. It is more often correct, complete and up-to-date, but it needs those comments to be written and maintained carefully and diligently. ## I think it is as stupid as writing comment describing what the code is already telling:String firstName; // first nameHow to express this in code?/* High number of our customers are molesters and having underage kids in here could be dangerous to them due to the current law */if (person.isUnderage()) {   disallowEntry();}Create a bunch of extra variables or functions just to describe this comment?Another thing is, when you’re in the zone (or in the wrong zone), all these fancy words came up that make sense at the moment. There are no other words that could have describe the code better. You two weeks from now wonder what kind of crack you were on, while other developers spend 2 hours oral fucking (cursing) your mom. ## I can quote a CS Prof “All bugs are in the comments”.I do disagree when there is sufficient information in the program to detect an invalid program state. I have also written tools which inserted consistentency checks into programs for this purpose.For example: checking that all dynamically allocated memory is released before the last pointer to that space is reassigned, this prevents memory leaks. Checking that looks are released in an order which prevents deadlock (or would potentially cause a deadlock). ## One cannot have two source of truth. Eventually they will go apart and will soon get out of synch.Similarly I think it’s not a good idea to have comment repeating what code is doing. Let code bring it out itself. And so “The code itself is the best comment.”Let me clarify also that I am intending to say that not to comment at all. Write the code in such a way that the need for comment goes a lo down, but still there are aspects which need some amount of commenting to bring clarity. Make sure those are updated with time. ## If you’re writing COBOL - maybe.Otherwise, there’s always some stuff that needs to be explained, reference, annotated, or what have you.Now, some of that should be in a concept-of-operations doc, a data dictionary, and a list/description of each code module - but there’s still stuff that’s useful to include inline. ## Do you want (a) well set out and formatted code with meaningful variable names conforming to good standards and practice but no comments or (b) badly set out and formatted code with meaningless variable names and poor adherence to good standards and practice but detailed comments.In that artificial dilemma it’s (a) all the way. Code is the best comment. But it’s not the only comment and it isn’t my silly either or choice. There are good reason to add some comments.Documenting comments that define functions are good practice. Reading code that you want to use to workout what it does is laborious and only defines its behaviour today which may not define it’s intended purpose. That’s doubly true when tools are available to extract them.Other comments that indicate where algorithms have been sourced or patterns being employed are always good value.Comments should ideally be augmenting the code - not repeating it or explaining what each bit does.So to quote The Importance of Being Earnest.It is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in civilised life should be.Robert Martin’s saying a pithy saying and has some mileage. But don’t get carried away.In the play, Jack replies to Algernons wit:I am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays. You can’t go anywhere without meeting clever people. The thing has become an absolute public nuisance. I wish to goodness we had a few fools left. ## It makes an excellent guideline for people who understand its meaning fully. Martin didn’t say that there shouldn’t be comments, which is a mistake I’ve certainly seen. I reword it slightly. My version is: Comments should be used to express what code can’t.There are things that comments should tell you:When there are multiple algorithms and/or data structures that could have been used to solve a particular problem, why was the one in the code chosen?For a given communication protocol, what document are you relying on for the definition, and which version(s) do you support?Code is good at giving names to magic numbers, but it doesn’t express where they came from. If you’re referencing particular hardware, a comment providing a link to the hardware design is appropriate.Code should absolutely express how it does what it does. Good naming conventions go a long way towards readability. To a somewhat lesser extent, it can directly tell you what it’s doing, but no amount of good naming will teach you why a particular algorithm solves a particular problem. It makes the algorithm easier to follow in the code, and should tell you what the algorithm is.What code can’t explain is why. That’s what I want to see comments about. Sadly, that’s one of the areas where comments are often lacking. ## Mr. Martin is a fool.Code is a great language in which to describe implementation at a detail level. It is a terrible language in which to express design intent, because it is far too low-level.

"/Whats-a-good-comment-code-ratio"," Code Comments,  Computer Programming","What's a good comment/code ratio?","War Story timeout: Many years back I was getting ready to undertake a massive refactor of 50% of the game systems on a project about to hit alpha. The code base was a mess - it had been used on 3 previous titles with extremely different feature sets and over 200 engineers had touched it in a 8 year period. However the project wouldn’t ship unless things were fixed - the performance was too slow and the bugs were too high.My boss grabbed a few books from personal library - refactoring and clean code type things. One was a recently released book - Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert Martin. Hell of a book - I think all programmers should read it.There is an entire chapter on comments and the debate on commenting code or making self documenting code. It is a very good springboard for this talk. </WarStory>I only comment when I’m thinking/attempting that would not be obvious from the code itself.Comments are a trap - as soon as the code changes the comments are dangerously out of date. Comments are rarely updated. I’ve seen comments that were for a function that was deleted still in that threw off how I looked at some code before I did a P4 history and saw why.When I code, I make sure things make sense. And make sense in a way that when I come back in 12 months to fix a bug, I’m able to just see whats going on and just do it. Comments CAN help with that. Making better code will solve that.The difference betweenif( someCondition == true && someCondition2 == false && someValue < 4 && otherValue != 2){ //do work} and//need to check if its okay to heal because heal block debug might be in effect if( ActorIsEligibleForHealing(someActor) ){	someActor.Heal();} Is the difference between a 5 minute bug fix and losing the whole day. ## I have already caused controversy with this opinion once, but I will risk it again:The ideal comment / code ratio is 0.Every time I read a comment about what code does, what I see is “I couldn’t be bothered to refactor this code, so deal with it”. The code must stand on its own. Comments are not checked by the compiler. Comments cannot be unit tested. They get outdated, and they become misleading, turning into a huge maintenance debt.If you have time to comment, you have time to refactor code in a way that will remove the need to comment.There are exceptions. Sometimes we need to optimise a very hot spot of the program and the resulting code is a little bit more involved. Sometimes there are weird bugs or strange features of APIs we use that require counter-intuitive workarounds. Sometimes the code is aimed at an audience that is much less knowledgeable than us. However, we should strive for good code before good comments all the time. ## Many people here have said that, in an ideal world, that comments are unnecessary, that code should be completely self-documenting. This is a philosophy that I disagree with.Think about what code -- even perfect code -- actually tells you. It tells you what it does. But this is only one question out of many reasonable questions. What about all the other important questions? How do you know what has already been done or what needs to be done or why it needs to be done?Here's the same code commented to reflect the above three example questions:Useless comment: What it does.//Close the gategate.close()Comment answering: What has already been done.//8 out of 10 gates should be closed at this point.//Only the emergency spill gate is open after this last one is closed.gate.close()Comment answering: What needs to be done.//Enter isolation mode: (Close gates, shutdown power, activate beacon)//Step 1: Close all gates but the emergency spill gate.gate.close()Comment answering: Why it needs to be done.//At this point, we've detected that the system does not//have enough power to last until the next charge cycle if left//in active mode. Enter isolation mode until next charge cycle.gate.close()So that's my take on commenting. Don't use comments to explain what the code is doing. Any competent programmer will be able to figure that out himself. Use comments to answer all the other reasonable questions you would ask about the code.-Patrick ## I largely agree with Paulina Jonušaitė , I think in an ideal world, your code will not need comments. However, we do no live in an ideal world.Just yesterday, I was writing some code to working Amazon DynamoDB (#startuplife), and that’s quite odd as it’s got a type for “list”, that’s cool. So you can put in a list of strings or hashtables, or whatever. However, it won’t accept an empty list, so if I need to remove all items, I can’t just remove all items, I’ve got to remove the value entirely from the record.That makes my code look non-obvious, so I put in a quick comment to bring attention to it.I think we should make our code obvious to read, and not need commenting, but sometimes we’ll work with APIs which are not obvious, and we might need to comment what we’re doing to deal with their lack of obviousness.Same for some APIs I use on IBM i, on that platform, you’re dancing between ASCII and EBCDIC, and it uses APIs which rather than take 5 parameters or whatever, they really just take a block of memory in a given format, and have names like QCLRPGAS and QCDRCMDI, so I don’t think it’s altogether crazy to pop a comment before them. ## The important thing is that every comment should add something that you would not see immediately from the code.Some, real world, examples of comments that are useless from a number of programming languages:x += 1;  // increment xEND;  #  ENDx = x * 1.1221432243293; /* Joes fiddle factor don't know what it is but it doesnt work without it */a = (INT64)b * (INT64)c; /* INT64 = INT32 * INT32 */ As you can see the above comments add nothing and may even be misleading or worse - the fiddle factor one was from customer deliverable source code.Thinking in terms of ratios will tend to lead comments such as the above, (all of which were from near 100% commented code).One exception I can think of from the top of my head where there is a fixed minimum comment ration is the practice in Python PEP-8 rule of starting every file, function, class or method with a comment that describes what it is supposed to do so python has a minimum comment ratio of 1 per item. This has two major advantages - a) you should be thinking about what it is supposed to do at the beginning and b) in python such comments are automatically embedded into the final code and can be retrieved with the helphelphelp command allowing self documenting libraries & code.Personally I find the practice of starting every file with the shebang and encoding comments that specify the file context and encoding very useful as is the practice with some version control systems of embedding automatically maintained file and version information to be very useful and think that every file should start with a comment to specify its intended use is a very good minimum.However, subject to that minimum, a lot depends on the complexity and subtly of what is being tried to achieve. I have seen files that were 100s of lines long that were simply initialising a large table of values to their default where the single comment at the top of the file simply stated that it was initialisation per a specific document. On the other hand I have seen a single line awkawkawk script that had and needed 30 lines of comments to explain what it was doing even to the guy that wrote it a could of months on. ## Generally, assuming you’re writing for reasonable competent programmers, you should keep comments to a minimum. Yes, I know this isn’t what you’re taught in school!Don’t comment things that are clearly said in code.Don’t comment things that are obvious to any competent programmer.Do comment “clever tricks”.Do explain what the overall purpose of the code is.Do comment the inputs and outputs of each function.Where possible name variables, functions and classes clearly - which helps with writing fewer comments.With those rules in mind, coming up with a “ratio” would be ridiculous. ## “What's a good comment/code ratio?”An expected ratio leads to unnecessary comments.Your code should explain itself through sensible functional naming. Your code should explain itself so comments are not necessary.The rule we use is only comment if you need to explain why you are doing something and never what you are doing. You should only have to explain why your code is doing what it's doing if it's something unusual or unexpected, like there are external behaviours that are not obviously involved.Following these guidelines, very little code needs to be commented at all. Definitely nothing close to 1:6. ## Everyone says the same thing. I will also say the same. Comments are to make your code readable, if it is not already readable. Unless you use some special trick, your code can most probably be self-descriptive. Someone using a bubble sort does not need to comment this part of code. But if you are a genius and have designed another sorting algorithm, you may need to comment the code. That is exactly enough.Naming your functions, classes, objects, variables and all other identifiers by understandable names should suffice for most of the cases. Don’t forget to indent the code. One line of comment to tell you what a long piece of code is to do will mostly be there.I think that comments will not be needed a lot. Of course someone using standard library functions will need less comments than one building his own. Also, it depends on the purpose of the code.Developing a standard library function to sort by your innovative method will not need to be commented, you need a full documentation. ## Comments are usually useless. Unless they:Specify contract. What is going in, in what form, what is expected output.Nobody reads function/procedure internals unless absolutely necessary.Types are, usually, give you such contract, but, sometimes they are too generic. List of lists of integers given two integers is worse than list of page numbers to be displayed in paginator template.Describe edge cases. What if we pass nulls to this function. What if we call it without arguments. e.t.c.Document stuff on the higher level. What is going where and in what form. Usually, higher level documentation is pulled out into specific README or project Wiki.Delimit stuff that should not be delimited on the semantic level. We shouldn’t create names for stuff that wouldn’t be used anywhere else. It adds complexity and gives nothing in return. Things like this are preferable:============= MUTABLE! saving dataset to db ========//////////////////// some code  /////////////////// ================== BOOKKEEPING ====================//////////////////  some code   //////////////////Describe what is going on in this file in the head section. It may also include License, authors names and the means to connect with them.It is also nice to mention if the function is mutable. And what kind of state will it mutate.As for things like this// Here we sum two numbers2 + 2Yeah. This stuff is completely useless."
"/Is-it-true-that-Windows-source-code-is-so-convoluted-and-messy-that-no-one-in-Microsoft-really-understands-it"," Source Code,  Microsoft (company),  Microsoft Windows,  Operating Systems,  Computer Programming","Is it true that Windows source code is so convoluted and messy that no one in Microsoft really understands it?","No, it’s not true.The source code base for modern Windows, written mostly in C, C++, and a bit of assembly language (and a dash of C# in some user-mode utilities), is based on the Windows NT project, which was started in 1988. It is the basis for all versions of Windows NT (first released in 1993), Windows Server, Windows 2000, and all versions of desktop Windows from XP (released in 2001) onward, including Windows 10.During my time in the Windows NT group, I had an opportunity to read the code, and found it was very readable, maintainable, consistent, and followed a solid set of coding standards. While the project source code has grown since then, I have no reason to believe that those standards haven’t been maintained. At roughly 55 million lines of code (last I checked, and depending on how you count lines of code), maintaining consistency and standards are critically important to ensure maintainability of the code base. While the clarity of the code can vary slightly from one developer to another (not all developers think exactly the same way, just like non-developer people don’t all think exactly the same way), the source code could not be described as anything even approaching “convoluted and messy.” And I personally know many people at Microsoft who understand the code today.Now, because of the sheer size of the project, most individual developers don’t have detailed knowledge of the whole thing at once. They tend to specialize and work on certain areas. This is typically the case in all very large software projects. When an individual developer does need to understand a new area of the Windows source code that they haven’t ventured into yet, they find readable, maintainable code there.Having said that, bugs exist in, and new bugs are sometimes introduced into, all non-trivial software that is being actively maintained or developed. This fact of life is not unique to the Windows project, and is not necessarily a reflection of the state of the source code. ## I’ve actually seen and had to deal with some of that kernel and Windows services code, and there is a lot of mess from place to place in the source code.That’s viewing kernel code, Explorer, their USB (various versions) logic, etc.. Back in 2005 and 2006, I had to actually debug a lot of it, and it was lazy coding and atrocious algorithms. So…it’s not that you can’t understand it. It’s just that perhaps they spread themselves so thin in terms of outsourcing and so forth that whoever is maintaining their codebase are idiots.Given how horrible their latest set of updates has been, it strongly suggests that either some of their developers are sub-par, or they just aren’t properly running the new code through a thorough QA cycle. ## Yes and no. Windows/CE and its successors are a mess for a variety reasons. All OSes are large enough that no single person understands them all but it isn’t necessarily because they are convoluted and messy. There’s just more there than any single person can understand it all.If you’re very curious about how convoluted Windows can be these days, I recommend the account SwiftOnSecurity on Twitter. Especially right now, it is spending time on the complexities of Windows and how the various teams interact with each other. ## It depends on the exact meaning. In the basic meaning, no, it’s not true.However the Windows source code is very large, so no single person understands it all at the same time. Different people understand different parts that they’re working on.Looking it yet another way, as in every large code base, there are some complex interactions between different parts, and nobody can say for sure in advance, if changing something would have some unintended consequences. People do their best to understand and predict that, and usually they’re right, but sometimes they aren’t. In this sense, yes, nobody, quite understands it. But that applies to every single large software project. That’s why testing exists.Which doesn’t mean that there isn’t plenty of messiness in the Windows code base. But it doesn’t get in the way of understanding. ## “Is it true that Windows source code is so convoluted and messy that no one in Microsoft really understands it?”No, it’s not true.There were source code leaks. You can check some of the code yourself. The kernel is very well written, elegant and efficient. Some subsystems are not so good. That’s normal in all projects of this volume. ## As tempting as it is to agree with the general proposition, I defer to the guy who actually read a lot of it. I believe you Mr. Gregg. Maybe it isn’t the mess that I have suspected that it is. But the problems with updates breaking things every time we turn around suggests that the situation is not as simple as you suggest. The code may be elegant, but the world is not, and Windows Discovery appears to be broken again. It isn’t a great confidence builder when something that appeared to be working fine suddenly breaks. ## Not, It’s not convoluted.I haven’t seen the actual code nor I have talked to someone who has written modules for the NT.However there was code contribution from MS to universities for studies. It was called the WRK.One can see the code -Windows Research Kerneland,Zer0Mem0ry/ntoskrnlOne can browse and see how if it actually is worthy of being called messy.I am guessing at best, just because some sample is not messy/not messy does not mean the entire platform is messy/not messy. ## No, it can't be true. Microsoft always pushes updates, which means someone understood the code to fix it and make a patch. Someone really understood the code to create a bugfix. ## This seems to be pretty funny as well as resourceful. Can I get this featured here?"

If I'm “explaining”, I'll use /**/.For example, if I'm commenting about an edge case if condition, fit to 1–2 lines, I'd use //.But for explaining key logic to some function, or documenting a function, I would use /**/.Main reason for the difference, for me at least, is just how an IDE will color them. Most IDE's will color them differently, meaning they are treated differently, and i can use them for distinctly different purposes. ## If you are using C I would recommend using the multi line /* */ style C comments.

"/Should-I-use-single-quotes-or-double-quotes-for-JavaScript-strings"," Coding Style,  JavaScript (programming language)","Should I use single quotes or double quotes for JavaScript strings?","I think it all comes down to your personal preference. As far as I know, there is no difference between the two styles in terms of performance.Ultimately, it all comes down to the most useful style for any particular string. For example, as Jose Luis mentioned, you might want to use double quotes if your string contains an apostrophe. At the same time, maybe your string contains double quotes and it would make more sense to use single quotes in order to avoid escaping those characters.I know it's an oversimplified example, but you could also think about the two possible styles of encapsulating strings as variations or instruments that fit better in a given scenario. Thus, it all comes down to the context of your particular use case. ## There is no one better solution; however, I would like to argue that double quotes may be more desirable at times:Newcomers will already be familiar with double quotes from their language. In English, we must use double quotes "" to identify a passage of quoted text. If we were to use a single quote ', the reader may misinterpret it as a contraction. The other meaning of a passage of text surrounded by the ' indicates the 'colloquial' meaning. It makes sense to stay consistent with pre-existing languages, and this may likely ease the learning and interpretation of code.Double quotes eliminate the need to escape apostrophes (as in contraptions). Consider the string: ""I'm going to the mall"", vs. the otherwise escaped version: 'I\'m going to the mall'.Double quotes mean a string. When you learn a new language like Java, Python, or C, double quotes are always used. This is because, as mentioned above, double quotes have always been used in language to indicate quoted passages of text. Old books will use double quotes, while newer ones may not. It may be desirable to stick to convention in certain cases.JSON notation is written with double quotes.Nonetheless, as others have stated, it is most important to remain consistent.Source: stackoverflow.com ## Use proper code autoformatter with preferred quote settings (jquery style or airbnb style or whatever you like), leave that kind of work to the code editor and enjoy writting apps instead.There is a lot of plugins for every popular code editor or IDE. Pick one which will work with your environment.In companies it doesn't really matter what is your personal code style. Hooks on repository will format the code to the company's standards after commit is accepted into repo. On your local machine you should write as you think it fits your needs. Formatting should help with readability for the specific coder. ## I prefer single.  (if the quoted string has an apostrophe or single quote, then double....but the situation can be reversed as well if you have double quotes in the string)I find single quotes look cleaner (especially on my non-retina monitor, where double quotes can look like a blur), and they don't require the shift key.This is one area that I really don't care about consistency.  It's not a big deal if it is one way in one part of a file and another in another.  It's pretty clear it's a string."

I haven’t studied Gang of Four in the academic sense in years. You don’t need GOF to write SOLID code 99% of the time.My arguments are regarding his defenses against me picking apart his code, in the context of practical real world rapid development. He might not have it right.I have no need for these factory/builder patterns most of the time. A configurable DI container & IOC pattern covers most of the bases. I find the factory and builder patterns, etc etc, redundant, require tons of boiler plate code, and give you absolutely nothing but a hard to read maintenance nightmare in return.That being said this is my argument against his defense:(Some of the reasons for using these patterns I’ve been given)“Strongly type the configuration”. So what? Is configuration that big of an issue most of the time? Then writing a bunch of unit tests to make sure your configuration works? It’s a bunch of self serving nonsense. Then if you’re using a DI container you can test config all you want, and the container can still be a point of failure. I see it as inserting arbitrary layers of abstraction for the sake of implementing a pattern you’ve been told you’re supposed to use.“Control the service object lifecycle”…DI container does this.People tend to use these patterns by default, when there is no need for it. In some cases they can be useful for integrating with legacy code, but otherwise YUCK, it’s not graceful and it’s confusing to read. ## What design patterns are relevant, varies extremely by what language you are using, so your question is interesting. I once read an article about how Lisp made 19 of the original 23 design patterns completely irrelevant, and 19 of these patterns had no meaningful implementations in Lisp - Which I believe, since most of the design patterns are created for OO languages, and often may I add to overcome OO difficulties due to OO’s design.In C# for instance, the observer design pattern is arguably implemented through events, and have been for almost 2 decades - So this pattern makes less sense in C# than in other languages that doesn’t have “events”.In Hyperlambda (my own programming language), you always have YALOA at your disposal. This completely eliminates the need to implement anything that “creates” objects, such as abstract factory, etc. So your question is highly relevant and interesting. However, it varies according to programming language, and not so much according to “new programming language features” unfortunately."

So, we made the printing smarter by first running the Selectric across the entire page and setting tabs at every 4 spaces, we picked 4 arbitrarily, it could have been 5 or 8 or whatever.Our printing software would scan ahead in the line and find sections of whitespace, where we could convert multiple spaces into a couple of tabs and then 1–3 following spaces. That trick really speeded up the Selectric, although I am not sure it extended the life of that device at all and probably shortened it.But, on columnar data, that printer really flew. ## Someone once had the bonehead idea of using tabs to indent program code and the war began. And the war is not over 4 spaces vs 1 tab, it is over using tabs at all. The number of spaces is not the issue, the issue is using a key code that is meaningless to indent code. There is no ambiguity in what a space character means. A tab has no inherent meaning, so it is useless.Tabs: Just say No."

"/Why-does-Fortran-outlast-all-the-other-languages-from-scientific-calculations"," Fortran (programming language),  Computational Science and Scientific Computing,  Calculations,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Why does Fortran outlast all the other languages from scientific calculations?","Back in the day I wrote Fortran for money for 6 months. It’s a dinosaur of a language but it gets the job done. Fortran was originally designed to be used by scientists and engineers at a time when calculators were mechanical devices:Nowadays you would use a calculator or a spreadsheet to do the job. But then the step up was writing Fortran, and it was just like every other tool that a scientist or engineer might need, something that you learned just enough about to get the job done.So imagine this - our favourite crusty old scientist has a workshop full of tools, all doing the job perfectly - hammers, tin-snips, a kettle, a lathe - all tools which were designed centuries ago and manufactured 100 years ago with absolutely no need to replace them because they do the job perfectly.Now imagine that Dr. Crusty has tens of thousands of lines of Fortran which took decades to write and are doing their job perfectly whenever he wants to calculate wind loading or reaction rates or something. Some of it he uses only once a year, just like I use my router only once a decade.He has no reason whatsoever to re-code it all in a more modern language. In fact, it would be quicker to write a Fortran compiler / emulator in Python than it would be to re-code all of his Fortran in Python. ## FORTRAN is a powerful language especially suited for scientific and numeric computing. It has been through many updates and modern FORTRAN is a powerful language. But all major languages have their purpose and usefulness and software engineers use the language most suitable for the task at hand. Also, I believe it is a mistake to say it has “outlasted” other languages, it is simply older than other languages (except perhaps LISP). Other languages like C/C++ are still going strong and are useful for systems-level programming as well as application development. Other languages like Java and C# have their uses in the fast-paced business application development world, where the speed of development often outweighs other considerations. ## Partly because it was first language used by scientists and there is a lot work invested in it.

Copyright is in the source code you actually write, to the extent it is original and creative.Is your source code original, i.e. did you author it yourself or did you copy it from another? Is your source code creative, i.e. did it involve choice in the selection and arrangement of elements comprising the work?I first set hand to computer keyboard fifty years ago this September, and I have always thought the hackneyed beginner code, “hello, world” in any programming language, was trivially useless for learning. It teaches the student almost nothing about computing and little truly useful syntax in the target language (unless you think I/O is the whole point).In any case, I seriously doubt your “hello, world” code meets either the “original” or the “creative” requirement to merit copyright. ## You automatically have copyright over anything you write, be it source code, or a novel. If you write it, you own it.However, realistically, you can’t enforce copyright over something so trivial and short and which isn’t new or novel.You can trademark something very short, in context. i.e. Nike can trademark “Just Do It”, but that doesn’t prevent you from a having a character in a novel shout “Just do it!”.Copyright has reasonable limitations though, you can’t expect to copyright “console.log(“hi world”)”, however if you used it as an advertising slogan or something, you could probably except to be able to trademark it. ## Copyright doesn’t work like that. In principle one doesn’t copyright things. The mere creation of a work establishes common law copyright. It is however difficult to prove later on when the work has been created and therefore it is helpful to establish a claim by explicitly writing that claim into the workCopyright (c) 2019 Fred Flintstone, Jurassic Inc.However, only works enjoy copyright protection. For a body of text to be a work it has to be more substantial than just one line of text.The text …console.log(‘hi world’)… most certainly will not qualify for copyright protection because it isn’t a work. ## Any creative work is protected by copyright so long as it has at least some minimal degree of creativity. Computer software, including source code, is protected by copyright so long as it meets this eligibility requirement. However, the code console.log ('hi world') would not be eligible as it is not sufficiently creative, having been written in the exact same way by many people prior to you."

Today I am going to tell of the major difference between R and Python.We know that R and Python both are open source programming languages. Both of these languages are having a large community. Both of these languages are having continuous development.That’s is the reason these languages add new libraries and tools in their catalog. The major purpose of using R is for statistical analysis, on the other hand Python provide the more general approach to data science.Both of the languages are state of the art programming language for data science. Python is one of the simplest programming languages in terms of its syntax.That’s why any beginner in a programming language can learn R without putting extra efforts. On the other hand, R is built by statisticians that are a little bit hard to learn. There are some reasons that will help us to find out why we should not use both R and Python.RR is one of the oldest programming language developed by academics and statisticians. R comes into existence in the year 1995. Now R is providing the richest ecosystem for data analysis.The R programming language is full of libraries. There are a couple of repositories also available with R. In fact, CRAN is having around 12000 packages. The rich variety of library makes it the first choice for statistical analysis and analytical work. Key features of RConsists of packages for almost any statistical application one can think of. CRAN currently hosts more than 10k packages.Comes equipped with excellent visualization libraries like ggplot2.Capable of standalone analysesPythonOn the other hand Python can do the same tasks as R programming language does. The major features of python are data wrangling, engineering, web scraping and so on. Python is also having the tools that help in implementing the machine learning at large scale.Python is one of the simplest languages to maintain and it is more robust than R. Now a day Python is having the cutting edge API. This API is quite helpful in machine learning and AI.Most of the data scientist uses only five Python libraries i.e Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn and Seaborn. It is quite handy to use Python over R. Key features of Python programming language:-Object-oriented languageGeneral PurposeHas a lot of extensions and incredible community supportSimple and easy to understand and learnpackages like pandas, numpy and scikit-learn, make Python an excellent choice for machine learning activities.R or Python UsagePython has developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python is the most popular programming language in the world. It has most powerful libraries for math, statistic, artificial intelligence and machine learning. But still python is not useful for econometrics and communication, and also for business analytics.On the other hand, R is developed by academics and scientist. It is specially designed for machine learning and data science. R is having the most powerful communication libraries that are quite helpful in data science. In addition, R is equipped with many packages that are used to perform the data mining and time series analysis.Why not use Both?Lots of people think that they can use both the programming languages at the same time. But we should prevent to use them at the same time. Majority of people are using only one of these programming languages. But they always want to have access to the capability of the language adversary.For example, if you use both the language at the same time that may face some of the problems. If you use R and you want to perform some object-oriented function than you can’t use it on R.On the other hand, Python is not suitable for statistical distributions. So that they should not use both the language at the same time, because there is a mismatch of their functions.But there are some ways that will help you to use both of these languages with one another. We will talk about them in our next blog. Let’s have a look at the comparison between R vs Python.R is more functional, Python is more object-oriented.R is more functional, it provides variety of functions to the data scientist i.e Im, predict and so on. Most of the work done by functions in R. On the other hand Python use classes to perform any task within the python.R has more data analysis built-in, Python relies on packages.R provides the build in data analysis for summary statistics, it is supported by summary built-in functions in R. But on the other hand we have to import the statsmodel packages in Python to use this function. In addition there is also a built in constructor in R i.e is dataframe. On the other hand we have to import it in Python.Python also helps to do linear regression, random forests with its scikit learn package. As mentioned above it also offers API for machine learning and AI. On the other hand R is having the greatest diversity of packages.R has more statistical support in general.R was created as a statistical language, and it shows . statsmodels in Python and other packages provide decent coverage for statistical methods, but the R ecosystem is far more large.It’s usually more straightforward to do non-statistical tasks in Python.With well-placed libraries like beautifulsoup and request, web scraping in Python is much easier than R. This applies to other tasks that we don’t see closely, such as saving the database, deploying the Web server, or running a complex selfie.There are many parallels between the data analysis workflow in both.R and Python are the clearest points of inspiration between the two (pandas were inspired by the Dataframe R Dataframe, the rvest package was inspired by the Sundersaute), and the two ecosystems are getting stronger. It may be noted that the syntax and approach for many common tasks in both languages are the same.Lets Sum Up R vs PythonNow you have got a detailed comparison on R vs Python. Both of these languages are having their own strength and weakness. You can use either one for data analysis and data science.Both of these languages are having a similarity in terms of their syntax and approach. You can pick any one of them, no one will let you down. Now you may come to know the basic strengths of these languages over each other.Original Source: https://statanalytica.com/blog/r..."

"/How-can-you-comment-code-efficiently"," Code Comments,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","How can you comment code efficiently?","The best comment is the one that explains WHY or the HOW you are doing something:E.G.:For this line of codei++Which comment is more useful in the long run (6 years from now)//Incrementing I//Loop Counter IncrementOr this casevalidate($a, $b)//Validate a & b//Ensuring that both a & b are Natural numbers, which are needed for the formula below, using X mathematical process.Commenting the “Why/How” ensures that the one who will see the code you wrote will undestand immediatly WHAT it does and if it’s doing correctly. If you comment WHAT it does, you cannot deduce Why and How you do it, and if it’s correct to do it that way. ## You don’t need to comment code ‘efficiently’, make it ‘clear’ instead.Use whole sentences. Short ones, but whole. ## Simple, short, tells what it does. That does not mean comment on every line though.I generally comment on every function, and some lines that does not make sense in simple glance. ## Name everything in your code well and don't do multiple comparisons in conditionals. For example, instead of doing “if(person.age>10 && person.age <30)” do “isMillenial = person.age>10 && person.age <30” and then check if isMillenial is true or false in the condition. ## By not commenting at all.A comment is not good, it is bad. A comment is a failure of expressiveness in the code. The code should be written in such a fashion that it is self explanatory and makes perfect sense without any comments.Of course, there will be occasions where a comment is unfortunately needed, but you should be very conservative with using them and instead put thought into the naming of variables, functions etc.I recommend reading Clean Code. ## Briefly explain what each function and line does. To check how efficient is it, assume that you know nothing about that particular code, would these comments explain to you what it does? If yes, hurray you did it. If not, you have some missing explanation. ## at first you have to give your variable and function name based on the purpose.After that why are you using this function and variable in the comment section. ## Don't say WHAT the code does…say WHY! ## In OOP I like the method where you first create a class with function stubs. Then you add documenting comments for every function and what it does. then when implementing function you first define as a stub with comments describing how you are solving the problem. Then you add code under each comment. And if you see it redundant remove the comment. example:/* This function searches the container and does some super cool  * stuff with elements with type elementType */void ClassWithElements::SuperFastElementManipulationFunction(int elementType)// loop through elementsfor (iterator<Element> elements = container.begin(); elements < container.end(); elements++){    //super smart looking code}Here is no need for comment in line 5 since it’s obvious that you are looping through elements. You can also use Doxygen syntax to generate documentation from function comment in lines 1–3 with Doxygen: Main Page."

"/To-what-extents-are-if-statements-avoidable"," Coding Style,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","To what extents are ""if"" statements avoidable?","They are unavoidable, and trying to get rid of them completely would lead to horrible code.But they are also easy to over-use, and an “if” statement with lots of else-ifs should usually be replaced with a switch or some variety of jump table, of which the v-table implemented under the hood in C++ to enable inheritance is an example.If you find yourself casting an object to different types of object in an “if”, you’ve probably designed your program badly. Likewise, deeply-nested “ifs” suggest bad design, like probably too few functions.In object-oriented language, long if statements can often be replaced by careful use of subtype polymorphism.Beginners often have a tendency to go overboard with “ifs”, because they are easy to grasp and the more elegant alternatives often not so easy. ## The syntax of an if statement is frequently avoidable.The usual example is the ternary conditional.if ( x === 0 ) { doThis(); } else { doThat() }Is the same asx === 0 ? doThis() : doThat()So you have avoided an if statement. Two actually, the if, and the else-if.Or have you? Not really; it’s just syntactically different. Conceptually you haven’t changed your code at all.Now here’s another interesting one; if you try to combine a whole bunch of if statements into a complex conditional, even though it looks like less code, more terse and all that, you can actually be damaging the performance of your code. Runtimes and such can use predictive and look-ahead algs to greatly simplify chains of simple conditionals; this optimization can be lost if you have a conditional that these algs can’t be applied to because they are overly complex.So depending on the context, getting rid of if statements can be a bad idea.But with all that said, if you see code that has chains and chains of nested conditionals, you probably want to take a step back and say, “what is all of this ultimately supposed to do?” More than likely you can find a couple of key conditions that can be used to shortcut the whole thing, maybe a different data structure could help eliminate them completely, etc.It all depends on the context. ## For the most part they are unavoidable and an essential part of any program.But if you are looking for an interesting albeit slightly more complex example - check out this excellent video by Misko Hevery. He discusses how you can actually remove conditional logic using polymorphism. While there is plenty of debate around this, it’s a very interesting perspective that might save you an if statement or two! ## There may be special, specific cases where you can get away without conditionals for small blocks. There may be some decision points that can be performed by expression evaluations.Loops, switches, exception catching, and certain tertiary operators are if statements in disguise.In the end, real-world applications have to make decisions, and that means an if statement. ## A resurgence of this myth… First, it depends on the language itself. You can go a long way if you cheat and use the ternary operator ? and :You can also replace them with a switch statement…Languages with pattern matching indeed can reduce their need of it a lot.Etc. But it is easier (and more interesting) to avoid the loops (in favor of functions like reduce, forEach, map, filter, etc.) than ifs. ## While I have not studied the situation in detail, I believe that without some form of conditional execution, a programming language cannot be Turing-complete.There are a lot of ways that conditionals can be implemented, including “if” statements. An implementation of a Turing Machine might not explicitly use a any conditionals, but it uses a state table which accomplishes the same thing:while (true) {  symbol = tape[pos];  transition = state_table[state][symbol];   tape[pos] = transition.symbol_to_write;  pos += transition.direction; // either +1 or -1  state = transition.state;}The logic of the program is encoded in the state table, and is pretty much equivalent to one big “if” statement, but not explicitly so.There are languages which lack “if” statements, but replace it with some other form of conditional evaluation. Haskell, for instance, has both “if” expressions, as well as pattern matching and case evaluation, instead of “if” statements. That’s typical of functional languages, which tend to not have many statements, and more flexible expressions that can be evaluated.Other languages provide conditional constructs to reduce the need for explicit or nested “if” statements, like the C/C++/Java/C# family’s “switch” statements. Similarly, the Replace Conditional With Polymorphism refactoring moves the conditional from explicitly in the code to the object-oriented inheritance mechanism of the language, but it’s still conditionally evaluated. ## As long as a programming language has ‘while’, it is possible to entirely avoid ‘if’.if (guard) then {  then-clause} else {  else-clause}can be transformed toclauseDone = Falsewhile (not clauseDone and guard) {  then-clause  clauseDone = True}while (not clauseDone) {  else-clause  clauseDone = True} (provided ‘guard’ has no side-effects, or ‘and’ is shortcut-evaluated)It's a terrible idea to do that, though. ## Two very good articles about thisEliminate many conditionals with this one weird trickWhere do conditionals come from?"
"/Can-a-program-be-programmed-to-program-itself"," Functional Programming,  Computer Programmers,  Algorithms,  Artificial Intelligence,  Computer Science,  Software Engineering,  Learning to Program,  Software and Applications,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Can a program be programmed to program itself?","In a sense of the word. Can a program come up with a novel idea and execute upon that, writing software to implement it? Not that I know of, we simply aren’t to that level yet.Can one write self modifying code? Yes, that isn’t uncommon, especially in domains such as copy protection or obfuscation (deliberate rearranging of code to make it difficult for human interpretation, for the purpose of hiding its intended function), where the code modifies its own instructions. This was more common in previous eras of computing from what I know, and can probably mess up modern cpu caches and the like. But the programmer designed the program to do this explicitly, it isn’t a “conscious” action of the program itself.Another domain similar to what you suggest is procedurally generated content - the developer provides “pieces” of content, for example, fragments of text, small areas of a game designed to fit together in various ways, parts of speech, etc. Then utilizing a random element together with rules about how the parts are meant to fit together, varying “unique” sets of output can be generated. These “pieces” can either be specified by the developer or garnered from analysis of existing material such as newspaper articles. In many cases the output is quickly recognizable as not truly random (or coherent, in the case of sentence generation). This isn’t exactly the same thing as the question in a literal sense, but is close enough I thought I might mention it.Someone else mentioned genetic algorithms and other types of machine learning techniques, and did a far better job of explaining it than I can. This also fits the scope of the question, in that over successive iterations the program gradually generates strategies optimal toward the accomplishment of some specified goal. ## Yes they can. I have tested doing this in C, C++ and Python with great success. Even as far as creating the very program that does so. It is amazing and fairly easy to be able to mirror all the code base with strings. After all the code is there where the string formatted parts can be copy and pasted for those methods to do so likewise.Python makes it even easier because it provides the _doc_ string ability. In this case you can simply copy and paste the mirrored code of each method, place them in EOL strings as “””text in here”””just below the method definitions and or class names and call them at will. It can store these in variables for the method to write to a new file for the new mirrored program. ## I did just this in college circa 1973. I wrote an assembly language program that changed itself so that the next iteration of it did something else. No. I'm not talking a conditional statement. The professor asked why would I do such a thing. I said to demonstrate that to a computer, executable code is simply data too, like everything else it sees."

Plus you will be more careful at making choices and eventually code better. ## Microsoft Visual studios builds in one of the best commenting strategies I’ve seen.All you need to do is type the ‘forward slash ( / )’ three times and Visual Studio will automatically add the XML tags for a summary about the class or method. The <summary> tag is the only source of information about the type in IntelliSense./// <summary>/// The description/comment about the method or class. /// </summary>/// <param name=""parameterName"">The description/comment about each parameter in a method</param> <param> - provides summary for each parameter in a method.NB: <param> tag is for methods/functions only.Once another developer wants to consume your object or type, Visual Studio’s will display the summary once you hover over the intellisense option for that method or class. Also, when a developer is trying to understand what a object/type/function does, all he needs to do is hover over the method name and the summary appears providing the information between the summary tag.Example:Result: intellisense showing the summary body of the ‘AddTwoNumbers’ functionThis can provide auto-documentation for your code.For more: <summary> (C# Programming Guide)"

You’re going to have to use some primitive types. I say use abstractions where they help make your code more understandable in the problem domain, and otherwise use a modularization strategy (create a library of common routines that the application code can use) when sequences of instructions get repetitive, since that’s a good method of organization for code maintenance. Make the best of it. ## When the code contains “primitive obsession” then the code reader has to find it out without having any idea about the intention of other programmers. also the goal of “avoiding the yo-yo problem” is to spend less time reading the codes.In other words, they both almost have the same goal so one should not be ignored to reach another."

"/Why-did-Microsoft-decide-to-capitalize-all-function-names-in-Window-API"," Coding Style,  Naming Conventions,  Microsoft (company),  C (programming language)","Why did Microsoft decide to capitalize all function names in Window API?","The Windows API was designed in the late 80s. Back then, there were few standards and lots of ad hoc innovation around different things.Function calling conventions -- the rules that define how a function is called and how it returns its data, and how it cleans up after itself -- were many standards because there was a lot of that ad hoc innovation.When a function is called, the way that the arguments to the function are passed to the function must be agreed upon by the caller and the function implementer. This agreement also has to cover the way that data is returned to the caller from the function, and who owns allocation and cleanup of the space used for temporary local data used by the function, plus the space for the arguments and return data.There are many different approaches, and anyone writing low-level code might decide to make up their own approaches, for whatever reason they might see fit. Arguments might be put into registers, or put onto the stack, or both. They might be consumed left-to-right or right-to-left. The caller might make some temporary space for the function, or the function might do it itself. The caller might clean up after the function, or the function might do that itself, too. Data might come back in registers, or on the stack; or it might be poked into a point in memory that was provided when the function was called.Then, there's the question of error handling; how can the caller detect that the function did something wrong, and broke the agreed-upon protocol? Is it possible to do so? How often can it check for such errors, or has the decided-upon mechanism just made that impossible?Since there were so many standards, some standards also added some additional rules about how functions might be named. With these rules in hand, information about the function could be discerned; maybe extra characters was added to the name, such that inspecting the name could tell about how the function was to be called.At that point in the 80s (just as today) there were several languages competing for the attention of programmers. Thus, there were several standards for how functions might be called. Microsoft didn't know which language (or languages) might become dominant, but it had to pick something so that it could get along with the business of writing the operating system and tools.There are some interesting constraints in the problem -- notably, the non-orthogonality of the Intel instruction set. Certain registers are available to do certain things, but not all registers can do everything. For example, certain registers can be used to de-reference a pointer, and others can't.Another tremendous concern of the day was memory usage. Back when Windows was being developed, a machine with 640 kilobytes was pretty big, and you needed to use a bunch of tricks to page in any additional memory you might be lucky enough to have. (About 25 years later, the computer I'm using to type this post has 98,000 times as much memory!)Microsoft settled on the Pascal calling convention. This has a few disadvantages (since arguments are passed right to left, for example, functions with variable-length parameter lists are not supported). But it did specify that the called function cleaned up its parameters, which can save lots of space in a bigger program.The Pascal calling convention, true to its name, also implies that names created with the Pascal ""camel case"" practice in mind. That is, ""CreateWindow"" begins with a capital letter, and each word within the name begins with its own capital letter. ## The WIN32 API was designed to be language independent. Some languages (C) are case sensitive and some (Pascal) are not. In 1985 Microsoft was not prepared to choose between them, so it adopted a naming convention that would work for both types of languages. ## The answer is because they could. If you are a near-monopoly, you can do something that breaks other people’s conventions and they can’t force you to change to theirs. It makes a lot more sense to me to capitalize a class (as in Java) or type name because it signifies a bigger concept, but what is natural depends on what you are used to.For something completely different, check out Introduction to Coding Guidelines for Cocoa.What makes this all annoying is the presumption that everyone only ever codes to one API. What if you want to target multiple platforms? You can separate out  machine-specific coding, but any naming you use that is in both your own code and machine-specific files could be inconsistent.Why did Microsoft decided to use backslashes in path names instead of the established Unix convention of slashes (and thereby annoying everyone who knows that “slash” is a complete description and you need not say “forward slash”)?The slash thing has antecedents in MS-DOS before there was a directory hierarchy, when a slash was used to mark command-line flags and could have caused confusion if used as a path separator – but had Unix users been in a stronger position to set the standard, Microsoft could have worked around this easily enough."

For example, a way to encrypt image data into a small file format that eats up a lot less space than the original format. This would apply to the JPG and MPeG file formats, that used to be patented.The difference is that copyrights generally last 70 years after the author has died. Trademarks are as long as a company exists, and possibly longer. And patents are generally limited to just 20 years or less.So if you wrote the encryption algorithm for JPG files in COBOL then your code would be copyrighted but not patentable. The JPG patent is known for a nasty controversy in 2002, as a company called Forgent Networks claimed to own the patent. They started demanding money from everyone who used this image format and as it was widely used on the Internet, this basically meant everyone had to pay. But their claim officially ended in 2006 as it was registered back in 1986… So if your COBOL JPG encryption was written in 2003 then you would have been violating a patent and would have to pay for it…Software patents under the European Patent Convention - WikipediaSoftware patents under United States patent law - WikipediaHowever, the European Union will not recognize any patent on software! The US doesn’t exclude them by law, though. It is very unlikely that your patent on your source code, if you ever manage to get it, will hold in court.Software code that might be patentable would likely be a new form of data compression or a new form of data encryption. But as mathematical formula cannot be patented, even these would fail if such an algorithm is just some mathematical formula.So, you can try but you’ll likely fail to patent source code. And even if you manage to do so, it’s likely going to fail in Europe and other parts of the World outside of the US. ## No. Source code itself cannot be patented, but it can be copyrighted, just as other works of creative expression can be copyrighted.An algorithm, which can be expressed and described in a variety of ways (and which might be implemented in the form of source code), can be patented. However, it is typically not referred to as an algorithm. Instead, it is referred to as a “system” or a “method and system.”That said, both copyrights and patents can be expensive to defend, and the details of the laws surrounding them vary from one country to another."

What is the preferred coding style today?","Isn’t that just nauseating?So, I have to respond. I like an underscore “_”.Why?This is because “this_is_easier_to_read”. But, “thisIsNotEasyToRead”.But, be that as it may, people are crazy for their Camel Case?Why?No particular reason.But, here are a few ridiculous ones.There are fewer characters for the compiler to process, so the program will run faster. (Aghghghg!!!!)It is traditional since the early days of programming. (You mean when you could only have about six or eight characters per variable name? But, now with gigabytes of memory, you could have a novel. So, we’re still doing it the old way.)The program will have fewer characters so that it will take up less space on disk. (Like your 500 character program is going to make a real dent in your terabyte disk drive.)The best programmers use Camel Case. (But, are apparently to lazy to hit something like the space bar. But then, the same guys don’t like to write comments.)Programmers have become accustomed to reading Camel Case. (But, since reading - books, newspapers, etc. - is not their usual activity why should they know how to use anything else?)There are natural languages just like Camel Case. (True - there are agglutinating languages in the world, and some that turn whole sentences into single words. Some are spoken by various tribes in northern Siberia. So, you have a place where you can spend your days and relate. Hope you like hunting for seals.) (no disrespect for these people, just programmer wannabes.)It all made sense while I was stoned. (That is an answer that I would expect.) ## It depends on the language you are using, really. And the company.In C, the convention is to use underscores and lowercase letters.In object-oriented languages, it’s usually camelCase. But, your names don’t have to be super long. If they’re that long, you should try rewording them. Or, if you’re Apple, make them extremely long and run with it.Yeah, you should really check out Apple’s Cocoa library.Make them as long as you want. Your IDE’s autocomplete can fill them in for you, so it’s not like you always have to type the whole thing.But, keep in mind that the shorter they are, the better it is. More readable, that is.For example, in a BluetoothDevice class, the device name could just be called “name”. I don’t need it to be called “bluetoothDeviceName”. I know that it is a Bluetooth device name, it’s in the fucking class. Likewise, just call the hardware address “address”. We don’t need it to be called “bluetoothDeviceHardwareAddress”. That’s just dumb.My point is, context matters. If you have a Cylinder class, just call the radius “radius.” Don’t call it “cylinderRadius.” There’s no point to doing that.If you use abbreviations, be consistent. And let everyone else know. Abbreviations should be agreed upon by the entire team.Bottom line, it’s up to your team. There’s no real rule on it. Rules of thumb are:Keep it short and sweet.Keep it descriptive. ## The purpose of variable naming is to provide a human-readable context (ie. the name stands in for the memory address where the value is stored).Using meaningful names helps make the code more readable because it can communicate intent (ie. if I name a variable “customerID” you can likely guess what goes in that, even without any other knowledge of the app).The specificity of the name should be dictated by both (a) the scope and (b) the intent / context of the data. Spending the additional time to name (and type out) your variable names can pay dividends in reducing the cognitive load of users that later must review, debug, modify, extend, refactor, etc. your code. (That user could be you, years from now!)If the variable is scoped to a single block (eg. the counter in a for loop) and is only referenced in one place, a very simple stand in (the commonly-used “i”) is fine — calling it “counter” might be more explicit, but it’s unnecessary.If the variable is used through a single method or subroutine, this is where a more meaningful name makes sense. If the language is strongly Typed (eg. C++), incorporating the type prefix can be helpful (ie. “sCustomerId” for a string containing the customer ID, or “iPaymentInCents” for an integer representing … well, I think it explains itself!)The variable name should be long enough that, if another developer is stepping into the method from a debugger, they should be able to figure out what that variable does with a narrow context (a few lines before and after). If it’s longer than that, you’re wasting characters at best and making it more confusing at worst (overly-long variable names create their own cognitive load). ## In the real world, larger objects are visible from farther away. Remember that when you’re naming things in your programs: The length of the name should be proportional to the distance at which it will be seen.A loop variable is only visible for a small part of the code so i, j and c are perfectly acceptable names. (And if your loop is not short, consider refactoring.)The name of a local variable is visible in a somewhat larger scope, so you probably want a name that’s a bit more descriptive, like idToNameMap or tokenParts. (The words “id”, “name” and “token” should be clear enough from the context of what the function does. If not, consider adding more comments explaining the function’s raison d'être.)A public class or function is visible to your entire code base so should have a name that makes it clear what it does without opening another file. You probably need a longer name to do that, like lookupAttachmentNameById or parseAndValidateSessionToken. ## descriptiveCamelCaseNames, regardless of their length ## for me the simple answer is to write code to the style guide that you are given.. or if there is no such thing then be consistent with a school of thought… ie clean codeif you are working in a code/review paradigm then follow what the reviewers expect.. so in my case it’s descriptive camelCase for variable names and descriptive CamelCase for classes (java)if you are expected to produce clean code then be as descriptive as you need to be (if you want to use abbreviations for things then do so, but agree on them… ie use either No or Num for number, but not both)again if you are expected to produce clean code and you feel a section of code needs commenting, then in all likelihood you can move the section of code to a method and use a meaningful name for the method, for example://This section of code calculates balancesblahblahblahis not as clean ascalculateBalances();…void calculateBalances() {blahblahblah}personally I prefer the clean code approach… it may only be 1 or 2 lines of code, but if it needs a comment or is reused then it goes in a methodBUT the really important thing at the end of the day is that the code is easily readable and makes sense so other than very trivial for loops you’ll never catch me using “i” as a variableif the method won’t fit on the screen then it’s too long, which makes hungarian notation redundant - you can always see the declaration (and if its a class or global variable, you can always utilise the functionality of the IDE to take you to the definition) BUT the variable name should be constructed so that this is unnecessaryI like a quote from Olivier Gillet (mutable instruments, a 1 man shop, embedded c++ dsp) - there are 3 people who work on my code: me, the me who’s fixing a bug in 6 months and the me who’s adding a feature in 12 months time…keep it simple, keep it descriptive, write it for the poor f***er who’s going to maintain it… you never know - it may be you!!! ## It is most important that you:follow your company’s coding standardswrite code that a random bright young thing just out of school can read and understand easily.never use names that differ from each other by only one of the standard typos (swapping 2 letters, doubling a letter, dropping a letter).write good comments. (I NEVER want to read a comment that says ‘increment i’ ever again). Put a comment at the top of your loop that says something sensible like ‘for every employee, calculate hours worked and withholding’ or ‘trace every light ray through the lens’, and then give the mathematical formula you are using to do that.I you are the only person who can read and understand your code, guess what, you never get any new development to work on, only bug fixes and enhancements to your old stuff. Boring. ## Honestly speaking, I don’t know and I don’t care. What I do care about is the common sense, not some sort of cultism or ideology of some immature and unprofessional architect or tech lead. It happened to me too many times to be “taught” things by them and I am just sick of it.We stay strong on our position, keeping rules that don’t make any sense, rules that don’t help us at all, but our code is like spaghetti, hard to understand and hard to maintain. This is just unprofessional and we need to stop!In the end I would like to encourage everyone not to let themselves got accustomed with bad customs. Do not follow the rules, but the goals, the principles. And one of our goals is to write readable code. So use a name that makes sense for your variable, one that helps everyone understand the code. Do not go in the other extreme using acronyms, because they are as bad as the long names. If you want to find more about clean code, watch Robert Martin’s Clean Code series. ## Some rules I’ve seen, which vary from organization to organization:Keep it under some reasonable length limit, like 32 characters. variableNamesThatAreReallyLongAreNotDescriptiveInTheIntendedWay.Don’t embed the type of the value in its variable name, especially in a strongly-typed language. iDontNeedToKnowThatThisIsAnInteger + kTHXBAI.Code provides context, variables aren’t used in some disembodied context-free manner, so use the shortest long name that gets the point across. clientToken is usually better than clientTokenFromHttpRequestParametersEverything new becomes old someday; don’t put history into your variable names. Instead of oldStyleHash and newStyleHash use md5Hash and sha1Hash if that’s what’s really going on, and mark one of them as deprecated in the inline documentation.Django is unchained. You’re more_likely_to_see_this as preferred style in some languages or frameworks, such as Django and Python — but the preferred style is the one your team uses, not the one some external style guide prescribes. ## Use variable names that convey can convey the purpose of the variable used.The purpose of a really long variable name is to convey to a programmer who might come across the code in future, the purpose of the variable. This helps increase the readability of the code. You need not necessarily use really long variable names if you can convey the purpose using smaller names.for eg: totalCost is a relatively smaller variable name, but can convey why is it being used. ## Long variable names are a “code smell”.What they reveal is that your methods / functions are too long.A variable name is intended to reveal the variable’s role in its surrounding context / scope.If the variable name is long, it’s likely that it’s trying to disambiguate the variable from many other, perhaps somewhat similar, variables, in the same context.That’s usually a sign you have too many variables or names in the context.If you have more, smaller, functions, with meaningful function names, then you can often get away with variables that are just called x and y. ## It doesnt have to be that long for a variable. The most important thing is to make it understandable and make sense to others who develop along with you.For example, you have variable that use join column in database like this userJoinRoles, can be userRolesJust make it more simple and understandable. If hard enough, put the damn comments. Alot of hipsters nowadays forgetting the 101 basic rule in programming. ## While I strongly prefer “camel” to “snake” case, that choice pales in comparison to the matter of how to construct names…Names are not descriptions and should not be treated as such!Good program development editors are good at showing formatted documentation comments for any defined name, so there is no reason to make names into descriptions. And, ironically, while many justify not writing documentation comments because “they become out-of-date and inaccurate,” we’d have to admit the same will happen to a descriptive name.Best to keep names and descriptions separate. ## Self documenting code is the goal here. That is much of your code is documented by the names you pick for your functions/procedures/ methods and your variables. This save a lot of time during debugging, maintenance and team work.If I enter an existing project I use the conventions in force at the time. If Im developing from scratch, I use CamelCase for methods and Hungarian notation for variables.The main thing is that you should be able to figure out from the names of things, their function or purpose. It wont matter which mechanism you pick as long as you’re consistent . ## Many programming languages have developed some of their own rules for variable name.In C#, for example, private members tend to be lower case, and would use camel case if they need to be multiple words. They also have a leading underscore. Public properties and method names are capitalized. Class names are also capitalized.I’m sure there are some other rules that I can’t think of right now. But regardless, different languages will have different rules. You can see what the prevailing naming methods tend to be by looking at the existing code in a project you’re working on. ## I'd say it's still the way to go. Short variable names are a relict of the times when every byte mattered, and those times are (thankfully) not coming back anytime soon.Always keep in mind that on average, code will be read 10x more often than it will be written. It logically follows that you should pick variable names that are easy to read, rather than easy to write. And with modern IDEs at your disposal, any variable name is easy to write, since you only need to type it in once. ## There is no hard and fast rule on this.Most teams and programmers end up with a middle ground of not too long and not too short a name.But nothing prevents you from following a pattern that is most useful for your team and context. The key is to be consistent. Most modern software systems are not that complex that you need really long variable names. (unlike maybe job control languages or C pointer or far memory manipulation programs etc., where there could be some value for extremely clear variable names)Also, for normal software systems, once you take into account the enclosing class or object of a variable, the variable names can be even smaller.E.g. Inside an Employee class, there is not much value in naming a variable ‘employeeName’, you can just use ‘name’. ## I call styleguides - Rules&Recommendations.Rules are for performance (time and space) and security.Recommendations are for other stuff like - extending, maintenance, documenting, …Naming (variables, functions/methods, classes etc) for me are in #2 and they are personal decision based on experience… So, I use long descriptive namesFor Methods and Classes PascalCaseNaming, but for variables c-style (cost_total) more often than camelCasing… ## SufficientlyDescriptiveCamelCase is the style. ## Get the book on Clean Coding by Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin or lookup youtube video. Like so many things in programming it is better to understand why you do things, instead of doing the because… ## I like camelCase, but I don’t like long ones, since they take too much time to type and edit. Also, if they are too long, they become a problem when you mistype and get an unrecognized variable name.My rule is about 3 words max, and it should be descriptive."

Coding standards differ from language to language.Like Typescript Pascal case is used for classes and interfaces. Check the coding standard for whatever language you use.Hungarian notation is just plain evil. Don’t use it. It is prefixing the object type to the label.If it conveys meaning to the code then postfix it. For example, I use somethingLabel because it is a label in the view and may not be clear from the code that it is a view binding.Prefixing m_ or _ for private member data is also bad. Again if you feel you need it, then postfix it. ## Basically, to improve readability for people or programs. Using mixed case enhances the recognition of distinct words while satisfying a language's prohibition on spaces (and sometimes _ as well). Indeed, a shop or language's ecology may have coding standards that mandate their use.Sometimes it's employed to convey extra information for the next programmer downstream. For example, a prefix or suffix may be helpful to indicate type or membership for languages that don't otherwise support such notation, and the programmer believes such would be helpful (""be specific and avoid assumptions"").Finally, mixed case may be used to conform to, or satisfy, a framework's standard or expectation for proper processing. For example, class names may need to denote their place in a hierarchy. ## This thing is what we call the code formatting.Camel case letters etc are used because it makes code look attractive and highlighted.One purpose is that it helps to recognize the errors in code, it provides a good alternative to spaces and underscores.Sometimes we need to write a function or variable name by combining two or more words but spaces are not allowed between them so we capitalize the another word to highlight it.Normal naming example:string username;string user_address;Good naming example:string userName; // here user name can be seen easily//ORvoid getUserId();Hope you got the answer.Cheers! ## When and why do programmers use Camel case, Hungarian case and Pascal case, etcs?They have more to do with coding conventions (or guidelines) of a language or a company or a project.Using same guidelines makes code from different modules of a project look similar even when it is written by different persons or different teams or even different teams from different different companies. But it appears as if the code is written by a single entity.You don't want your code to look likeuser_id getUserId(st_user UserName);That just looks unattractive. Are we separating words using underscores or are capitalizing them? What about first letter - is it capital or small? Is this code part of a proper project or someone is just typing their whims away?Camel case (camelCase) is first letter of first word small and first letter of remaining words in capital and no underscores.userId getUserId(user userName);Pascal case (PascalCase) is all word capitalized and no underscores.UserId GetUserId(User UserName);Hungarian is tricky and has too much to do. You need to prefix symbol names with their types too.struct stStructureName; //st - structureint iCount; //i - int//sz -string terminated by 0//cArr - chat arraychar szString[32]; (or cArrString)bool bStatus; //b - boolfloat flLength; // fl - floatunsigned long ulValue; // ul - unsigned long...

Letting other to maintain is not sustainable, nor free of risk (e.g. if an other large company will buy a product, and go in a different direction, just to damage the other companies).For this reason, cloud companies must hire core developers, and they should pay such people to continue development.The problem is about the “side programs”, which we tend to forget. These are not on the core of business: they just work, so very few people care about them. Now Linux Foundation will found some of such essential project, and Linux Foundation is founded by major companies.So for large companies, there is not much problems. The problem is on new project, with new companies or other small companies, which have no money, so they must risk more, so they take (and often without giving anything). This is a problem, because developers will fund themselves with own company works, and such companies have competition of the free riders.As Debian Developer, I know many other DD works for such cloud vendors, and some of the cloud vendor will sponsor us (e.g. your conference, or directly Debian). And we are only one brick on the entire ecosystem. [BTW if your company want to help Free Software and Debian, you could contact me, or just search “DebConf Sponsors”, for possibilities to sponsor next conference] ## The Open Source movement is no enemy to capitalism. It encourages people to go and build profitable enterprises based on its work.The philosophy is not about profit, but rather secrecy. Open Source just wants developers - everywhere - to have the option to improve software, and to review it for possible security holes.If you’re running closed-source software, who’s to say that some government agency hasn’t planted a back-door to illegally access your data? (There is some evidence that Microsoft and the NSA did just that back in 2000 - _NSAKEY - Wikipedia)Open Source offers “open covenants, openly arrived at.” No being tricksy.If you can make a fortune with it, more power to ya.In fact, those profitable enterprises using OSS very often turn around and return the favor by donating staggering amounts of man-power and code back into Open Source Developer. Google’s been the most generous, but others like Facebook have also “paid it forward”. And, in a twist of fate that would seem unthinkable 20 years ago, Microsoft - once the mortal enemy of Open Source - has done a complete reversal and is contributing code like crazy to OSS.The OSS model has really proven its superiority both technically and economically. ## Most open source projects allow commercial use of the software, so this is not misuse.Writing a software and denying commercial use is possible but would seriously limit it’s applications."

My code was riddled with lots of comments, covering everything from simple assignment to complex implementation choices. As I evolved as a programmer, I realized that way too many comments can be just as bad as no comments. As you read through code, you develop habits - and if comments are everywhere and of questionable utility, one of those habits is skimming past the comments. In essence, by commenting too often you end up negating the truly useful comments by drowning them in a sea of inanity.Now the practice I follow is best termed as ""Why, not What."" Much of your code is pretty basic - assignment, simple manipulation, setting flags, and so on. If those elements are following reasonable coding conventions (meaningful variable and function names, decent code organization practices, and so forth), there is no reason that the code as listed cannot serve as its own documentation. In that case, the only things that truly need comments are those items that represent more complicated development decisions. For example, if you choose to use a bubble sort over a merge sort (for some odd reason), you'd want to add a comment explaining exactly why you chose the less efficient algorithm. If there is complex use of external resources, add a comment explaining why it is important. Any time you think a developer might have a question while reading through your code, that would be a good time to add a comment.Finally, the important thing to remember is that comments are not necessarily just for you. On a team project, things move very quickly. In as little as two months, the code you wrote can be quickly superseded by other tasks, and you can completely lose track of all the reasoning behind your deliverables in the first place. Furthermore, comments can save a lot of time for other developers maintaining your code. Most developers have horror stories of modules consisting of undocumented spaghetti code, written by that one developer in the organization whose development practices are ""untouchable,"" and the hours they wasted trying to track down simple errors in overly-complex code. So while it may seem like a waste of time now, the cumulative amount of time gained over maintenance and further development more than offsets the minimal time spent writing the comments in the first place. ## There are two schools of thought. One encourages extensive coding, the other would rather have minimal comments. The risk with heavy commenting is that if it is not meticulously maintained to be synced to the actual code, someone trying to maintain the code following its initial development may be thrown way off track when they read (and believe!) the comments. This could conceivably lead to some bad outcomes. I worked with a programmer years ago who actively discouraged commenting for that reason. He always felt it was best to read and understand the code itself. ## To paraphrase another great coder, make it as simple as possible and no simpler.I usually stick with generalities for classes and methods to avoid the comment maintenance issue. However, if I have to code around some bug in the system whether it's browser based, language based, or other infrastructure I spell out exactly why I have to do something in a specific way.If a particular process has a lot of steps, I usually detail the steps to give some one else a general idea of what is going on. I also comment things for myself to make sure I didn't miss anything, and then if they don't contribute much to the understanding of the code I delete them.I'm a pretty firm believer in ""the code should document itself"" but I'm not so rigid in my thinking if something unusual is required. ## It depends.  A practiced documentor is providing a great service.A poor thinker  can leave many loose-ends and gaps.(A mathematical writer, should, I think, do well  - they knowwhat a definition is.)See Page on civilized.com  (= www . civilized . com / programming.html)for an essay on documentation."
"/What-does-this-if-statement-code-mean-in-JavaScript"," Coding Style,  JavaScript (programming language),  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","What does this ""if statement"" code mean in JavaScript?","tl;dr: String.match() returns “null” with no match, and an array of matches if there is one.!== and === are not identical and identical comparison operators respectively. “Identical” is not to be confused with “equal/not equal” (==/!=). For example “false == 0” with evaluate true, while “false === 0” will evaluate false.Also, you are not matching the value of ‘i’. This appears coming from an iterative loop. Given the string you provided it would look something like:var str = ""+d+=3=+s+""; for(i in str) {	if (str[i].match(/[a-z]/i) !== null) {		//do something	}} (though there are a million possible sources for the value of i)on the first pass, i would equal 0, so str[i] (or str[0]) would contain “+”this is then matched against “/[a-z]/i”, which is a case insensitive regex matching on any of the letters of the alphabet between and including a through z. the String.match() method will return an array on a match, and null on a failure, which is why the “!==” bit is important.=== and !== are identical and not identical comparison operators respectively. “Identical” is not to be confused with “equal”. For example “false == 0” with evaluate true, while “false === 0” will evaluate false.So, in the abovestr[i].match(/[a-z]/i) !== nullwill only match on the second and sixth pass, when i = 1 and 7. Every other time it will return “null”, and not execute the code in the if block.Do directly answer your question, I am really not sure why they would use “!==” as String.match() will either return null or an object, if “i” is somehow higher that the last element in the string array, JavaScript will simply error. a “!=” would have sufficed. As it is written, it is not wrong, and it works, I am just not sure why the need for an identical operator. ## I'm not certain where the “i” in “str[i]” is coming from but I'll assume there is a loop somewhere that is cycling through the characters in the string one character at a time.The code in question is trying to check if the current character in the string matches a letter of the English alphabet.“str[i]” gets the character of the string at position “i”. So if “i” is 0 for example the “str[i]” would be the same as “str[0]” and it would get the character at position 0 in the string, the first character. In your example the character returned would be “+”.The “match(/[a-z]/i)” part uses what we call a regular expression. It says “Match against the letters a through to z in a case insensitive way i.e match whether upper or lower case”. That “/i” at the end of the match statement inside the bracket is what makes it do a case insentive match.If it finds a match the result will be the match it finds. If it doesn't find a match then the result is null. So that “ !== null” part is basically saying “if it matches anything”.So in the case of i being 0, we try to match the first character in the string which is “+” against the English alphabet a-z. Obviously it doesn't match so the match statement returns null. Since we have a “!== null” we can't satisfy the if condition and we don't enter the if block.I hope that makes sense. ## The i in the regex means to use a case insensitive search. So the regex is basically testing if the character at position i in str is any letter, upper or lower case.str.match will return null if there were no matches so str.match !== null is true when there is a match.To summarize, if the character at position i in str is a letter, you execute the if statement. It would be true for the d and the b in the string from the example above.There are a couple good reasons to check against null using !==, but it doesn’t make a algorithmic difference in this case. Without the !== null, the statement would be more ambiguous and less performant, but not less performant really in any significant way that you would likely need to care about. If (str[i].match(/[a-z]/i)) { without the !== null should give the same result in all cases. However, its a good habit to always use a strict comparison as without the !== you are looking for just a truthy value. The string “false” is truthy, the string “0” is also and so is -1, but “”, false, and 0 are all false. If match actually returned -1 if there was no match, if (str[i].match(/[a-z]/i)) { would always be true. That’s not how match works in this case, but thats an example of how some functions work that would get you in trouble if you didn’t check for an exact match against -1 and assumed a truthy or falsey value. You really should always use the === or !== out of habit whenever possible, which looks for an exact match of the value and the type instead of just a truthy match. You have to carefully think through your code this way and always know exactly what the function is going to return. That makes it harder to write in some cases, but makes your code less brittle. A good Javascript linter will usually check for this and fail you unless you use the !== or ===. JavaScript Lint ## You could think of !== operator as “is different then”.So, match function expects regular expression which will check if some letter (str[i] in this case) is somewhere between A and Z (lower case in your example). If regular expression finds match, it will return it, otherwise, it will return NULL (test native functions or read documentation).If it’s different then NULL, it has a match,and finally we have:if (matchResult is different than NULL){ someCode();}There are also some tricky ‘falsy’ values of javascript you should check (false, null, 0, undefined…), but here, since you are comparing, you need to know what you expect from function to return. ## In addition to Chris Barnhill answer:Maybe the programmer who writes it, comes from a strongly typed language and it’s better for him to read !== null instead without it. (Note that with double equal sign is not only checking for value different from null, but also checking different of type null).By the way, in my opinion, is better to read without the comparison operator. ## !== nullmay be ommitted. It looks like the author was trying to make the expression easier to read. In my opinion, that actually makes it harder to read..matchreturns an array of the matched parts of string. If nothing matches it returns:nullIf you only wrote:if(str[i].match(/[a-z]/i))your if statement will still check to see if it returned something that isn't equivalent to boolean false. ## Not exactly what you describe. We match the value of the i-th entry of the str array against the regular expression.When you ask yourself such question, it is good to look at some reference like String.prototype.match(). It says it returns “null if there were no matches.” which answer your question. Indeed, null is “nothing”, so it says there is no match.So the block after the if will be run if there is at least one letter in the string.[EDIT] Reading other answers, I realize that str indeed could be a single string. In this case, I suppose it is done to do an action on each letter character of the string. Not sure which one, since the match result (the capture) is not used. ## str contains a stringi is any index, it can be in a loop or outside loop.str[i] means ith character of stringstr[i].match(/a-z/i) checks ith character is equal to any of character a-z and return true or falseas a whole it checks if a specific character maches with a-z then it will go inside if structure and execute the code. ## Think to “different from nothing” as “equal to something, no matter what”. You check for a..z and no matter what you find (b, c, d …) you do. Unless you find nothing. ## (I’m assuming that “str” is the string being checked).Basically, it looks at the “i”th letter (the letter in position “i”) in the string and sees if it’s a regular letter of the English Latin alphabet, uppercase or lowercase.The string ""+d+=3=+s+"" has two letters: “d” and “s”. It would match “d” and “s” and the program would do something with them.Note that this is not a good solution. What if your users were from other countries (i.e. France) and they used special characters? ## Because if … else statement is a conditionals, that mean it will test whether an expression returns true or not, and then run different code depending on the result. So if i is match a-z and not null, then do an action, if not, then do another action. ## [proto_code]if the value of [i] in the variable str matches the expression /any character a to z case insensitive/ and is not the same and equal to null.When we use a triple comparison === / !== we are checking if they are the same and equal."

"/What-are-the-reasons-for-not-commenting-your-code"," Code Comments,  Software Engineering,  Computer Programming","What are the reasons for not/commenting your code?","Contrary to the popular opinion of treating sprinkling comments all over your code as a good thing - no, it isn’t.Code is text. It’s prose. If I need to have a narrator, or additional annotations, to read your text, then your text is bad - using poor language, structure, style, or all of the above.Ideally, your text conveys your thoughts in a clear and concise way and is not diluted by meaningless annotations, or comments that are there for the sake of having comments. A couple of guidelines that help in achieving this:Similarly to how you split a long text into paragraphs, you split long methods into shorter ones. That is well-aligned with many other software engineering principles, but we are just focusing on readability here.You name these functions using well-phrased, easy to remember monikers, that adequately represent what these functions do.You treat all your objects like that, actually.You do not duplicate text.You extract behavior into classes and data into structures.There are many other ways that help in making what your code does obvious, so that comments become superfluous. So, strive to make comments superfluous!Now, comments are by no means a bad thing. They are there to catch reader’s attention and that means they temporarily divert reader’s attention away from the actual code. So, you must have a very good reason for having them there, since I normally don’t want my attention diverted trom the code. Here are a few questions that discover these good reasons:Is there a hidden gotcha in the code that I can’t possibly infer?Is there a danger that is all but obvious?Are there any assumptions in the code, of which the reader may not be aware?Is the algorithm below tricky enough to be supported by a few examples?All of these are solid reasons to have a comment. In this context, they are little warning signs, or subtitles, or additional explanations that make me aware of things that are not obvious, but important, and it wasn’t possible to express them adequately in code.So, treat comments as a valuable resource. Don’t waste them on silly things and keep in mind that superfluous comments are, perhaps, a worse crime than not having comments at all. Use them where they really matter. ## Reasons for commenting your code:- Coding standards where you work require it.- You want others to understand it (without too much trouble).- You want to understand it yourself (without too much trouble) when you come back to it some time later.Reasons for not commenting:- While you're working on it comments are unnecessary, take extra time, get in the way. And if you change the code you have to change the comments! It's a PITA. If you're like me what you're doing is so perfectly clear, for the time being, that comments are superfluous. (Unfortunately, if you're like me, when you come back to it some time later that clarity is gone, and has to be re-constituted laboriously.)- You don't want others to understand it. Of course they'll figure it out if they have to, but not as easily as with comments. If that's your purpose, BTW, even better is to put in plausible, but misleading, comments! If they assume the comments are valid, and you design them cleverly, this can really throw them off :-)Bottom line: Comment your code, thoroughly. Take it from one who has always been uncomfortable doing so, often regretted not doing it well, and finally learned the lesson. Even throw-away little snippets you think you'll never use again deserve a quick description, at the top, of purpose and method. ## What are the reasons for not/commenting your code?If possible, your code should be self-documenting: the variables, and function names, and the demarcation points where you choose to split an operation out as a separate function, should all be intelligible and self-documenting, such that given a fundamental competence in computing and the implementation language, the reader can figure out what you’re doing and why you’re doing it from reading the code, and the variable names, and the function names.Sometimes, alas, that’s not the case. Sometimes, you find yourself having to write code that’s not very obvious at all: either the obvious ways are all too inefficient, or you’re not skilled enough to think of an obvious way. (And that’s not a put-down: sometimes, it takes a genius to first find what will become obvious with hindsight.) Whichever is the case, you end up writing baffling code, which may confuse the next programmer to see it, or (worse yet) prompt them to rewrite it as (a) incorrect, or (b) clearer but critically less performant.When you find yourself unable to write clear code, because you can’t figure out how or because pragmatic concerns (like speed) unfortunately make it impossible, then leave a comment to explain why you did it this bizarre way. If I’ve worked with a profiler and obtained important gains by inlining some operations that conceptually seem like they really ought to be separate functions…then I’ll make damned sure to leave a comment explaining that I know that it could be inlined, but there are good reasons not to.Also, since public functions should be black boxes, be sure to document your API: the functions, the parameters, the outputs, the pre- and post-conditions and guarantees. Depending on your language and toolchain, this will be more or less automated.If the comment explains what the code is doing, but it’s obvious from the code, then the comment is worse than useless. Useless: because you could just read the code and gain the same information. Worse: because the implementation may be altered, and the comment and implementation drift out of sync, so that now instead of a merely superfluous function document, you have a positively misleading one.I try to keep my comments ‘conceptual’: explaining why I choose to avoid the obvious in face of some problem; or summarising something that I simply cannot properly abbreviate as concisely as a variable or method name. ## Documentation aside (which is extremely beneficial), inline comments are USUALLY bad, because:They get outdated. Developers change the code, but do not bother to update the code as well.They create noise. How many times have you read through code with so many comments that made understanding the code more difficult ?They create misunderstandings. There is a single source of truth, the code. However, people tend to rely on comments, since they are bored to read the whole source code.In one sentence, comments reveal the developer’s inability to express his/her intent through the code. Ideally, one should be able to understand everything just by reading the code.How’s that possible ? Try to “encode” your comments in the naming of the variables/functions and the structure of your classes/objects.Simplistic Example:List<Node> shortestPathNodes = graph.traverseWithDFS()VS//calculates shortest path with DFSList<Node> nodes = process(graph)That said, comments can be useful for extreme cases, an example being:There is a specific business requirement that requires a temporary “hack”, so it’s beneficial to provide some context to future readers. Still, this should ideally be part of documentation instead of inline comment.To sum up, keep comments the absolutely minimum needed. Otherwise, developers will get frustrated and won’t even bother to read them. ## First, let’s make some definitions. There is good commenting and bad commenting, an entire shading inbetween, and then commenting that’s not kept up to date.// Stores the value of fooint foo = 5;This is bad commenting. Commenting a simple line for the sake of having comments is unnecessary. It describes syntax, but not semantics. Not all semantics need to be explained either; for example, using int i in a loop is self-evident for any reasonable programmer. Good comments explain semantics that would otherwise not be self-evident or instantly apparent.// The current number of document pages, incremented only by writerThread.int pageCount = 0;In this case, we have semantic information related to the data (the current number of pages) and the interaction between threads. This is one facet of comments.Another facet of comments is frequency. Some schools of thought argue that almost every line should be commented. This is counterproductive, not necessarily because there is so much to read, but because there is so much to write. IDEs and toolings will help to keep code in sync and current, but comments must be updated manually. Imagine the foo example above, again, but we have refactored the code.// Stores the value of fooint bar = 5;Now this becomes troubling. The comment is expressing a semantical limitation that might either be absent from the code, or, worse, referencing a valid other variable whose semantics differ. This will be confusing and require more time spent than the comment actually saved.The final type of comment is method (and class) comments (which double as documentation). To me, this is the most important type of comment, and one of the most worthwhile ones. A method is something that performs a sequence of operations, has upper and lower bounds and edge cases. Let’s take a simple example: Java’s String.split() method.This is a reasonably simple method, as described by its own first line: “Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.” Sounds easy. It even gives a link to the regex documentation that you can use to get additional information. The documentation continues on a bit though; it notes this is a convenience method for a more complex invocation (with a reference to the more complex one), and finally an illustrative example.These things are important. Unless the reader is instantly familiar with your methods, knowing what to expect of a method — especially in the edge cases — is invaluable. Reading every single line of your method (and all the methods it may call in turn) would surely give the answer, but it would take longer and an edge case may be missed. Thus, in this case, documentation is incredibly valuable as it allows another programmer to not have to read every single line of code.Don’t go too far though. Let’s have a look at the MSDN definition of the .NET library’s String.Split method. This should be a simpler method, as, unlike Java, it does not accept a regular expression. However… The documentation spans “Syntax”, “Remarks”, and “Examples” sections (with version history notes and other references). There is a lot of documentation there — too much, in fact. The syntax only references the remarks section, while the remarks section implores you to read about alternatives before reading this documentation. There is one example in the “Examples” section but several things that look like examples are in the Remarks section, including documentation about a different method (Regex.Split) and regular expressions (remember: String.Split does not accept regular expressions).Every comment added, especially internally in a method or class, will become a liability to the coder and reviewer the moment it is written. If you have made the right calls on their importance, the reviewer should catch if the coder hasn’t updated a comment. This is still additional work though. Furthermore, every comment added is more things for a reader to read. Thus, the best comments — much like the best code — are done when there’s nothing left to remove.So, after all this, when and how should you comment? Don’t comment for the sake of it. I use the following things as guidelines (but, like any guideline, there’s reasons not to do it. Or to do it when the guideline doesn’t say it)Do comment code (method body, variables, etc) when:You’ve made a judgement call. “I could have used XYZ here, but I used ABC because…” This is useful because judgement calls can be personal, and another programmer might go “why did you do this???”The code was forced, because, e.g., a bug, mandated feature, compatibility. Code done this way looks out of place, and someone looking at it without the context provided by the comment may be tempted to remove it, thus reintroducing the bug or breaking compatibility.A non-obvious optimisation is introduced. Optimisations can often be counter-intuitive, so explaining them helps having them maintained. As always though, don’t optimise prematurely.There are important side-effects, such as another thread reading or writing a variable, or interplay between a given code block/line and external code/state. (This may be a sign that the code needs refactoring, but that’s the topic of a different story).When denoting a functional block in an inlined. For example, python code can often make very short expressions (for [x in x in list if foo(x)]) that can be awkward to read. It’s then easier for a reader to read the comment with “lists all files with .json extension”.Do comment methods (and classes) when:Intending for them to be used by other parts of a larger piece of software (e.g. component boundaries; data store, computation, data views, UI, model, etc). Also when it’s an API.The method performs a non-trivial to understand operation. For example, a “save(file, path)” method may be trivial (and can skip documentation), even if it explicitly throws a PathOnUSBStickException. But if it cannot save files that contain Cyrillic characters and throws an implicit RuntimeException if that happens, it’s worth noting it.The method has differing base and edge cases. String.split() above is a simple example of that.Finally, comments are an invaluable tool to measure your code’s complexity. If a reviewer asks for a comment here or there, you’re pretty much good and just need to explain edge cases or reasoning. If you repeatedly get questions on your code, it might be an issue that needs a non-comment solution. ## No matter how verbose your method names are, or how neat your code is, you can’t possibly document WHY you have chose to implement something in a certain way. There are often external factors such as complying with legacy systems which mean you have to structure something in a way that may seem unusual. Furthermore, there is no downside to commenting your code, a lot of the answers here seem to suggest that the absence of comments makes your code better, or that by commenting, your code must be bad. When in reality it can be a little extra help for the next developer.You can also automatically generate neatly formatted documentation from well commented code. ## I’m in favor of comments in general. Some good reasons not to comment are if the comments are too numerous and describe something that is completely self evident, then code maintenance means possibly removing comments at a later date so they don’t describe something that is no longer true. Also, if the code is so complex that it can’t be understood by just reading it, then I think that speaks to a larger issue. Write good code, make your intentions clear, and that goes a long way to self documenting. If there’s a tricky piece of code that you think people will misunderstand, and there’s absolutely no design way out of it, write some comments about it. ## Comments can hide code structure.Comments can easily get out of date.Basic rule - comment where it would be useful to a future code reader - never comment where it would not help a future reader of the code. ## IMHO comments are an integral part of refactoring . To answer the question - you may want to skip refactoring because of deadlines or inexperience. ## I doubt there are good reasons to comment code. Maybe decent ones can be found in some cases.Disclaimer: The exception is Javadoc. I love a good one.You should have numerous and very serious backup explanations if I caught you putting comments into the code. Comments are failure. Anytime you have to write them, you failed to express yourself in code.Comments:Are lying - code changes, and comments are left there.Distract the programmer - you concentrate on code, then suddenly you decide to interrupt your mental flow and read and consume a comment - just to find out it had no use.Will be ignored 99% of the time, thus they occupy room on the screen unnecessarily.Will confuse you. Barely could be found an engineer who could produce meaningful and practical ones.Sometimes they are appropriate. But when this happens, it should have its reasons, and I dare it to have good ones.I suggest you to read Clean Code, it really has the potential to make you understand a lot of advanced software development principles, such as not to comment the code. ## Most code does not need comments so long as the methods are short and well named, the variables too have good names, and the code has generally been written with readability in mind.Occasionally it is necessary to add comments when even after a couple of rounds of refactoring the code is still difficult to read - but this should be the exception. Adding comments instead of refactoring is generally consider a code smell."

But how did it get missed in the first time.” - the junior dev replied.“Don't know. But you should be careful while writing the fix, it should not occur again. ” - the senior dev replied.The junior dev started working on a fix. While working, he found the fix is very easy and any school level guy can also do. How did it is not fixed yet?He went to the senior dev again and explained the fix he did. The senior dev heard the solution and approved it. The junior dev, out of curiosity asked, 'who had written this code?, I have seen your commit in Github.’The senior dev knew that he had written it, but he doughed saying that 'the guy who had written left the firm’. The junior dev got it that the senior dev was hiding his mistake. He himself could have fixed it but he didn't try. Why it happened, no one knows, as he is senior so no one can question him. The junior dev left with the open question.After a few days, an intern joined. The senior dev asked junior dev to work with the intern and train him. The junior dev started assigning tasks to the intern. Since because of the intern, the workload has been shared and the junior dev started losing command over project code and issues. He became casual while writing code snippets.One day, a mail popped up on junior dev's mailbox. The mail was about some critical bug on which junior dev had worked on. He called the intern,“Can you fix this?” - the junior dev asked.“Yes, Sure. But how did it get missed in the first time.” - the intern replied.“Don't know.

You might question someone's calibre, but It is possible that the reason could be different. So instead of thinking too much, just go and ask. If you get the answer, fair enough, else just leave it and move on. Most importantly, learn from these mistakes, so that you will not face the same situation.Think about it.Cheers,Vimal ## I am nearing senior development in UI/UX web software as a coder implementing Javascript for novel application functionality, not for good-looking sharable scripts. The reason is quite simple, I code myself for Rolls Royce parts never made to outfit a Trabant Limousine.So while under the hood my code rocks as far as luxurious speedy functional self-explanatory chained scripts go, no “agile” coder would want to touch my macaroni code (better than spaghetti) simply because it doesn’t cater to institutionalized coding patterns.So yeah, I keep my secrets to myself, in order to preserve an edge, ya know what I mean? I don’t code for other coders, I code for my applications, period. So what does that got to do with the question you ask?Well, knowing my credentials, if you tell me that my code is “bad”, then I’d show you my middle finger and warn you not to piss me off. And if you’d tell me that my code is “bad” because nobody else can “maintain” it, then I’d say “You’re right!” and open the door to kick you out, after I slammed your skull into it (hate being bothered for nothing).But if I was working in a coding environment within a team that must follow certain guidelines in order to secure productivity and maintenance effortlessly, then, and only then could you remind me that my code doesn’t fit the proposed patterns, requires more maintenance than usual, that my code appears to contain more flaws than considered normal, or maybe I need some time better spent at learning the newest coding trends before actually working on the next project, etc.That would be a best way to handle “bad code” issues, regardless of age or experience of the affected coder. ## First off, any senior developer has had the experience of looking back at some nasty old scrap of code, thinking “Who wrote this abject crap?!” and discovered it was their own.We already know we can write trash in a hurry.Does your team do code reviews? If so, just write specific, clear questions in the comments. “I'm struggling to understand this. Can we get more descriptive variable names?”If not, then there's your problem. Talk the boss into it at once. Code reviews are awesome. Expose the juniors to good code. Encourage the seniors to write clearer code. Just the threat of having to explain it encourages writing it cleaner.If you can't make that happen, then it totally depends on your relationship with the senior. You could play dumb and ask questions. You could tease. You could refactor it and ask for a review. You could just get over it and move on.Just stay humble about it all, whatever you do. The point is to improve the product, the process, and everybody's skills. It is not to prove that you're the coolest, smartest kid on the block. That way lie endless pissing matches. Please don't go there.—Tim. ## You don’t because it isn’t bad.It might be logically flawed, stylistically at odds with team standards, not performant, inelegant, too verbose, too terse, not readable, poorly named, or fragile. It might follow anti-patterns, be untestable or contrary to architectural standards, violate language idioms, break tests, introduce regressions, confuse team-mates, or be poorly documented. It might recreate existing library functions, abuse third party APIs, cost far too much to run, or use language features which are already at end of life. It might create tech debt and make iteration more difficult. Their code might start a revolution.Tell them any of that or whatever else might be true of their code but don’t just say it’s bad. Doing so shows a lack of technical depth and imagination. Do better by your colleagues. ## Be specific about “what is bad”? Just calling it bad helps no one, there’s nothing to go on so there’s no way of fixing it.Instead explain what is wrong with the code? Does it need a different algorithm? Is it sub-optimal in performance? Another data structure? Does it cause crashes / bugs somewhere else - if so where and when? Does it not comply with the team standards? Identifier names not descriptive enough, or too verbose? Too many, too few or not useful comments? Etc. etc. etc.One or more of these things is “why” it’s bad. That is what you want fixed. Just telling them it’s “bad” is not going to help.Assuming “senior” means they’re experienced, they already know they can write bad code, especially in a hurry - having noticed it themselves several times over when looking back at their old code. We’re all human and make mistakes. There’s often a lot of misunderstanding - thinking you’ve figured out what was asked but getting it all backwards.These sorts of things are very common, and an experienced programmer should have run into them numerous times over. Thus they would not feel insulted when pointed out to them, or at least not if they’re decent programmers.Often things like code reviews help to address these things. It’s why such ideas were even invented. As long as the descriptions of the “critique” is good enough to explain the problem, it can easily be fixed. The less understandable the critique is the less useful it becomes. And just calling it “bad” is about the least descriptive critique imaginable. ## Everyone writes crap code, at any level some of the time, this can be due to stress, deadlines, experimental code that shifted to production real fast, and wasn't given the refactoring it needed.Please bear that in mind as you approach it, he may or may not be aware that it's bad, look for a constructive way to recommend improvements. Though if he knew it was bad when he wrote it but was limited in time to get something out, he should comment as such.Now if ALL his code is bad, well that's another story, he could be in a senior position just for length of time he has been there, in which case he probably hasn't been learning too much. Just going through the motions.I'n either case, it's about providing a quality product, when that is the core focus, and you can demonstrate something constructive to that…. it's up to them to be open minded enough to listen to feedback. ## First of all, it's probably not as bad as you think it is. Is it in working condition? It probably is. That's why it hasn't been looked at for a long time. You could refactor it, but the better option is to wait for the “end of life” of the product. Why are you looking at it in the first place?It's probably not as bad as you think it is. It's more likely that you don't like his coding style. No need to request diversity training on this one, just move along. There are quite a lot of different way to code. You have to be open minded about it.If it was really bad code a customer would have called about it because it would have created issue on there side. Inquire about the current process in your team for this. It's most likely you would benefit from code review. ## Don't tell him his code is bad! If you feel his code isn't good enough, just ask him questions about his logic, approach etc. If you're still convinced that his code is bad you suggest ways to improve. Whatever you do be nice and professional. Nobody likes to be told their code is bad. ## You send him the following program:IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.PROGRAM-ID OKBOOMER.PROCEDURE DIVISION.MAIN.	DISPLAY 'Your code sucks.'.	STOP RUN.That is COBOL, for the un-enlightened.On a side note, that code will not run because it has one period sign missing.If you cannot identify the line number with the missing period sign, ask the senior developer what to do.I am pretty sure he will kindly point you to your proper course of action, that involves a physical impossibility. ## To add to the other answers about being specific, which I fully agree with.If someone has more experience than me at anything I don’t tell them that what they are doing is bad. There is a chance that what looks bad to me might be smart for someone who knows better than I do.Instead I ask a question about what I think is bad. Then the expert will either realise that they have done something bad and correct it. Or explain why the thing is not really bad and I’ll learn something. ## Usually I create a test case where the code fails reliably. Then when he ignores me, I show the results to his manager. And then I walk away.I take all the emotion out of it. I’m not criticizing him. It’s the code that is faulty and it needs to be fixed. He can do it or someone else. That’s a management issue, not a technical issue.I can’t fix stupid. Stupid belongs to his manager. ## If you do code reviews, a good attempt would be giving remarks there. Just give them a bunch of constructive criticism. Supplement your opinion with multiple sources backing you up, just don't try to be “know-it-all”. Suggest alternatives, ask questions and you should have a productive discussion.However, be aware that some people just don't get it and won't go into discussion. Nothing can be done about those and if it bothers you too much, I would consider a career change. ## Before you tell him your opinion, ask him if there was a reason he did it the way he did.I am a senior developer, and sometimes it is almost impossible to explain my code to junior developers… their eyes glaze over and they look at me like I’m speaking some ancient extinct language.Anyway, my point is, it might not be bad… you might simply not understand all the reasons (e.g., experience, background) they did it the way they did. ## Are You sure it's like You don't understand their purpose? A lot of times criticisms like that reaches management and then the code performs 100x faster, and reduces a day process to minutes… and somebody still saying “but it's Bad"" ## A Senior Developer is someone who understands team dynamics and respects the other disciplines needed for delivering great software. ... A Senior Developer who can work with a team and utilize all their skill sets have usually worked on many projects and learned you cannot do it all by yourself.”website development company in mumbai"

It’s not up to you, the choice already has been made.Want to write an iOS app without OOP? Good luck, not going to happen.Want to write a website while ignoring the object orientated DOM? Sorry, but that decision is final, the web is OOP.Don’t get roped into paradigm warsOOP is great for most things, less optimal for others.There are two types of people who don’t like OOP….Experts who’ve evaluated everything and come up with real reasons.Beginners who’ve never written real software.Don’t be part of number two, understand things before you decide they are bad. ## Q: “Why would you use OOP when you are the only developer of your own project?”Because I don’t want to over-complicate my own project with too many lines of code that I have to modify on each iteration or change of one part.If you’ve got 100 people working on a project, and some of them have some spare time, it might make sense not to use OOP in some cases.If you’re on your own, and not using OOP, and something needs to change, it’s all up to you.If you’re on your own, which is often the case, irrespective of environment, you want to use OOP to simplify things. Anybody who isn’t doing this is doing themselves a disservice in wasting their own time. ## The benefits of OOP have nothing to do with the number of people on a project. To ask this marks you as potential management material. Lol What you really want to ask is what are the benefits of OOP? ## Always. If anything, I need the benefits of OOP more when I am on my own than when someone else can review me and catch my mistakes.But generally, if a technique is advantageous, you should use it all the time. And if it isn’t worth using some of the time, then it is probably never worth using. OOP is, to me, one of my most important everyday tools."
"/Why-do-we-need-comments-in-code-Why-isnt-there-a-language-thats-so-clear-that-comments-are-basically-unnecessary"," Code Comments,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Why do we need comments in code? Why isn't there a language that's so clear that comments are basically unnecessary?","We need comments to remind us of what out thoughts where we we originally wrote the code.Unfortunately, many programmers don’t write good comments.For examplelet input = read(inputChannel);let output = (input * supply)/maximum;Those are 2 lines from some code I wrote yesterday, I’ll tell you in a moment what they do, but first, let’s add some BAD COMMENTS.let input = read(inputChannel); // Get the input valuelet output = (input * supply)/maximum; // Set the output value to the input value multiplied by the supply and divided by the maximumNow lets do the same again, but this time, we’ll add good commentslet input = read(inputChannel); // Get the current reading from the input ADC converterlet output = (input * supply)/maximum; // Multiply the input value by the current supply voltage then scale it by the maximum ADC reading available, before writing it to the output DAC converter.Exactly the same code, but the comment makes all the difference.In the second one you should be able to understand that what I’m doing is taking some input from an analogue to digital controller (ADC Chip), scaling it to the voltage the chip is running at and sending it back out of another chip to convert the digital back to analog (DAC Chip), and even though you may not actually know what a DAC and/or an ADC is, you should still be able to understand the basics of the conversion math, because the good comment adds context to it.A lot of developers, especially those that don’t write a lot of comments, and tend only to write them because they work on a team, write comments like the bad example, which really don’t help because they just tell you exactly what the code is doing, and any developer that can read the code, should be able to tell that without needing the comments.Good comments act as a basic form of reminder, as to what you where thinking (or the original programmer was thinking) when the code was first written, and exceptionally good comments actually serve to help document the code, so someone who knows nothing about a project can get a reasonable grasp on what it does.Now try writing a complex bit of code, filing it away for a month or two, then go back to it without any comments, and see if you can pick up straight away from where you left off.As for the super clear language part of your question, I have two previous answers that will help you with that one.Peter Shaw's answer to Why do we need Python if we just have C, Pascal, BASIC, Scheme, Java and tons of other programming high-level languages?Peter Shaw's answer to Why have mankind not made one programming language that fits all needs and applicable for any complexity of software engineering? ## Honestly, it's not the language's fault we need comments in code. A lot of good answers have already been given, but I think there's something here I can add.Dan North is one of my favorite speakers. He talks a lot at conferences like GOTO and he has some brilliant things to say about software development. Basically he says that good code tells you what it is, but good code doesn't tell you why it is.His reasoning is that although code should be self-documenting, it won't explain why it's needed or what other alternatives were considered (i.e. why the programmer chose that particular method). A lot of comments that I see day to day say things like ""looping over the list of X"" right above a for loop iterating over a list. It's painfully obvious from the code, so it's not a very helpful comment. Some others that are more informative say things like ""needed for edge case Y"". That way, I know what it's supposed to do and, more importantly, when it's no longer needed (e.g. when that system gets refactored). A lot of code hangs around when no one has time to read and try to determine if it's truly needed or not. It's a lot better to be safe than refactor, now own that part of the code, and be sorry. A lot of experts will say that with proper software development best practices that kind of thing shouldn't happen, but who hasn't been rushed to get a feature or bug resolved and implemented something functional but inelegant and poorly documented to maintain velocity?Anyway, the best use for comments is to explain why code is there, not necessarily what it does.""Why do we need comments in code? Why isn't there a language that's so clear that comments are basically unnecessary?"" ## Why do technical books (and even some non technical ones for that matter) use footnotes, references, glossaries, appendixes, etc. when the text is a complete work itself and is clearly written in your native language. Simple it provides additional information contained in the text itself. The same can be said of code.Now consider that when you read code, you frequently aren’t reading the whole thing like you might a book or chapter of a book. Nor is code organized a nice linear progression like a book.Also consider that the next programmer asked to update your code may be new or otherwise unfamiliar with with the language or your style of coding.Finally, those often annoying comments at the beginning of every class, property, function, etc. In some languages such as c#, these comments when in the right format can be compiled to documentation of your code and show up in tooltips and other programming aids for anyone who might be using it. Projects can even be configured to generate warnings when such comments are missing from public classes and methods. ## Of course your code should be clear as to what it is doing - for instance - this :for employee in Employee.objects.filter(manager=True):    employee.bonus = employee.wage * 0.1	employee.save()That is a potentially real code snippet in a hypothetical system (written in Python with a Django like ORM).It is of course reasonably obvious (even to non experts) what this code snippet is doing; for each employee who is recorded as a manager - give them a bonus equivalent to 10% of their wages.If you come across that code in 6 months time - it will still be obvious what the code is doing; but will you remember why ?Wouldn’t this be better ?# As per Agreement with union - all managers get a 10% bonus# See file BigCo/Managers/Pay/2018/agreement.pdffor employee in Employee.objects.filter(manager=True):    employee.bonus = employee.wage * 0.1	employee.save()Now the code isn’t only clear in terms of what it is doing, but also why it is doing it- and it is the why which is really important to understand in future how that code should be maintained (or deleted).No matter how expressive code becomes - even if you were able to write code like this :Give every manager a bonus equivalent to 10% of wagesYou still don’t have the why unless you have a very complex language which would support something like this :Based on 'BigCo/Managers/Pay/2018/agreement.pdf' Give every manager a bonus equivalent to 10% of wagesA language definition that supports this level of expressiveness is a long time away - and is unlikely to be possible I would have thought. ## If you know a language, you can easily read it and know what the code does. The languages we have are already clear enough for that.But computer languages don’t record why you are doing that, what it assumes of the rest of the system or the data, things like that. And they probably shouldn’t be able to express that, either.Are you implementing an algorithm from a published paper? Put a link to the paper in a comment, that saves you writing the whole paper in your code as justification as to why to do it this way. ## There were 2 questions expressed here so I'll address the latter.There already exists a language so clear and English-like, that - when coded properly - require no comments. That language is COBOL.In COBOL variable names can be composed with hyphens to enhance readability.In COBOL all the commands and syntax are composed the way you would naturally expect them to be written. For example, assigning the value to a variable is accomplished by coding: ""move x (the value) to y (the variable) "" Isn't that a lot clearer than coding: "" y=x "" ?This is the reason 70% of all the world's data processing systems are still written in COBOL .And just remember, only in COBOL is the statement ""GO TO HELL"" an actual programming command. ## Oh, this question takes me down memory lane.Thirty-some years ago I managed a small team that took over responsibility for a small database engine from another software team across the country. The code was written in a PL/1-like language. The other team’s philosophy was that if you wrote structured code (in their eyes, no ‘GOTOs’), and used long variable names, there was no need for any comments or other documentation at all.Our team of about six people spent six months trying to learn this code. To no avail. It did not help that the data structures had no discernable design. EVERYTHING was a global variable. And there were over a thousand of them. So in order to understand the semantics of a variable, one had to search the entire code base, and then repeat the process for any other variables accessed in the neighborhood of the variable of interest.In that six months, our team managed to fix one bug in that code base.Now, this team had maybe 30 person years of software development experience. We weren’t newbies.Needless to say, at that point we abandoned it in favor of a complete rewrite. ## Because comments cannot explain why something is done, nor what was not done.Some if the most densely commented parts of my code are because I have has to rewrite it several times because the first two or three algorithms had failings. I put in comments describing the discarded mechanisms so nobody tries to do them again.Another common need for comments is to reference the standards document which required the code to be written, It will be obvious, for example, that a line of code limits a value to a range. But why does it need to be limited and who defined the range. A similar sort of comment is the the bug reference that caused the code to be added.The blocks of code, particularly functions, need a sort of “user manual”. Not explaining what the code does, but why you should call it, what its preconditions and postconditions are. You might, if you are clever, be able to deduce those from the code. Bot why should you have to read twenty or thirty lines of code to work out how it handles edge conditions? ## For me comments are not about saying what I’ve done, they’re more about why I’ve done it.Just this weekend, I put in some weird code to make something go faster, quite a lot faster in fact. The code looks weird though, anyone else reading it would say “why the hell is he only checking that 1 time in 30?”.The reason is that checking every single time was far too slow.So while anyone who can read Java will be able to see what is happening, they won’t know why it’s happening, unless I comment it. ## Good question.Personally, I try to avoid comments - I believe that if you model your code right it eventually becomes self explaining, this is especially relevant when coding strictly business-logic oriented services where you can adapt things like Domain Driven Design which strives to actually map the business domain’s reality into code 1:1, without needing of ,,translation” which in turn makes comments redundant - why need comments when your code already was geared towards expressing?On the other hand, when coding some low-level stuff or in any other environment where due to various reasons using above-mentioned techniques cannot be done, I still strive for minimum amount of comments by using descriptive variable names, clear language constructs ( I really hate novadays’s syntax sugar that make me cry I gotta learn more code semantics while gaining no practical advantage ), as simple as possible algorithms.. etc. ## The language I've used that requires the least comments is COBOL. You can get a pretty good idea of what the code is doing just by reading it, if it's well written. At the other extreme are languages like APL or PostScript, designed to be succinct rather than self-documenting.As a general rule, I don't heavily comment code, because if I write code carefully, another programmer can figure it out pretty quickly. Writing clean code is a better use of limited time than writing comments to explain messy code. And extensive comments require extensive rewrites each time you change the code, which is unbelievably time-consuming and error-prone.An exception is assembly language, which I comment extensively, often on every … single … line. Assembler is so time-consuming to code that including comments doesn't make it much longer to write, and individual machine instructions do so little that it can be very hard to figure out what's being done without comments.Overall I prefer to prepare separate documentation to explain the way software functions, if I have the luxury of time to write it. It can serve several audiences, notably support teams and end users, and does not require access to or analysis of what may be thousands or millions of lines of code.Unfortunately, in today's world, most projects provide neither time for extensive comments nor time for proper documentation, even in the largest software companies. The pressure to get it out the door is very high, and since some companies treat technical support as a revenue source, leaving bugs in the code and/or documenting it poorly may actually make the software more profitable in certain situations. (Want the bug fixed? Buy the update. Want to know how to use it? Take the certification course.) ## A while back, I was working on a large scale ETL pipeline using Spark. The pipeline would crash immediately after loading data in one step. After doing some investigation, I found that there was a bug in the data-loading function which meant the data wasn’t properly distributed across the cluster of ~60 computers used for the job. This bug was fixed in later versions, but upgrading was a fairly intensive process that we would need to test heavily for, so I added a manual repartition as a workaround, along with a comment line:// Workaround due to bug (JIRA ticket URL.) Should be able to remove this when we upgrade to 2.1.2 or higher.How on earth would you communicate that without comments? ## It isn’t possible. There are certainly choices that reduce the need for certain types of comments. For those of us who remember the days when most compilers had very small limits on the length of symbols, one of the biggest is allowing symbol names that are long enough that you can express what your variables and functions are in their names.However, programming languages express what to do, but not why it’s done. That’s what you need to comment. Yes, for any given collection used in any program I’ve written in the last decade, I had a choice of several different collection types that could each have done the job. The reason for choosing the one I did isn’t captured in the code, but it may be useful to the next team maintaining the code.Sometimes I’ll write comments that tie particular code back to specific requirements. If I’ve done that it’s usually so that a later maintainer can see exactly where the modifications for a new feature were implemented.These are areas where even if the language supported explicit constructs for expressing the information in the code, those constructs would simply be specialized variations of comments. They express things about your code that aren’t executed and can’t be enforced by a compiler, but are useful to know. ## Please permit me to allow a man much wiser and more experienced than myself explain this to you.“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand” - Martin FowlerEven in a language as clear as Python, comments are still necessary because your aim is to write a program that humans can understand and not every human have had a background knowledge of programming so you have to write it for those people to understand.Programming is basically giving instructions to a computer and as we all know, the computer doesn’t understand the English Language, it only understands binary (which is machine language). English is very ambiguous; it takes complex analysis and context to understand; different words could mean different thingsFor example;“The English Teacher” could mean a teacher from England or a teacher that teaches English so how would you tell the computer what you mean?I believe there’s no programming language that is as clear as any natural language, that comments won’t be needed because all natural languages are ambiguous in nature. ## I agree that we should explain why, while well-written code can usually do a good explaining how. But some code gets complex enough that you may want to explain how at a higher level than the code can do. A good example is code that composes the objective function and constraints for a large optimization problem. There can easily be tens of thousands of constraints in some problems I’ve worked on, and you will typically need to both lay out the abstract form of the problem as well as clues to which parts of which constraints the various bits of code are composing. This type of code can be very hard for even the original author to read after a few months without good guidance in the form of in-line commentary. ## With some very complex programs, routines, algorithms there can be a lot of code with many variables or operations going on, construction of internal structures, etc. and the coding choices can vary widely.Even during the development, prototyping phase you might want to read how a given routine operates, why it was written in certain way.Especially important when multiple programmers are working on system.I have personally been in control of all 80,000 source lines of a vendor software produce to which I was frequently adding features.I didn't hook-line-and-sinker believe every comment but the notes can usually give a glimpse into the logic.NOW, about inventing a language that does not need comments; I have some ideas. As to your question of WHY isn't there a language so clear that comments aren't needed; some languages are so detailed like IBM Assembly or some that can “supraload” the statement line, there is a word for that but I cannot think of it at the moment, such that it would take quite a while to decipher the statement without hints that comments provide.I can solve that, but that is for the future. ## I think that whenever writing a codeFirstly, We should document in comments what is the purpose and what are we exactly going to do in our codeWe should provide a short algorithm in comments before starting the code.When we start the code, we should have a comment for each loop and condition like what it does and when it stops.At the end of code we should have the time complexity.I think there is no such popular programming language which is so clear that humans can directly understand. Comments are very important for the analyst and the programmer because when a bug is found in a program, it is easy to find the location of that bug and it can be fixed easily by programmer. It becomes easy for analyzer to read and understand the code and find the errors in the code. When it comes to someone who has no knowledge of programming, he can atleast understand purpose of program. hence the comments are very important in a code. ## Go TDD (Test Driven Development). Write beautiful tests. Let those tests be documentation for your code. No need for comment lines. ## I’d Say that something like AppleScript or maybe even python could fairly easily be read without comments, but with the added easiness to read, you add ambiguity, and thus reduce the usefulness and maximum capabilities of the language. ## Part of the problem with writing code is that you may intend to do something but your code may actually due something else. By reading your code I can determine what you code is doing but it does not tell me that your code is doing what you need it to do.Comments are also very useful for reuse of code. By documenting what your code can do and the limits that it works with I don’t have to read all of your code and the code it calls to determine what your code can do for me. This type of documentation is also useful when writing your code. Once you have a full awareness of what your code should do you can go about making code the fulfills those requirements. ## There's a language that has exactly that as one of its primary design points: to be so readable as to make comments unnecessary. It's called COBOL. ## No matter how clear the language’s syntax is, a comment is still going to convey more information and more relevant information. Let’s say you have a long function … a smart comment can help you avoid diving deeper into that and save you time. I believe code should have as much comments as possible and needed. I actually believe the best way to teach is by using properly written code commented properly and explaining “for idiots” everything. The world of Software Development is lacking a lot in the teaching department. It seems to me like most of those who write books just want to brag with what they know instead of trying their best to make people understand. ## A different reason to those listed: during development, you may want to try something without a section of code active, or create an alternative version of some code to test something. Programmers comment out the code they temporarily don’t want to execute. Otherwise, they’d have to delete the code by probably cut and paste into another editor window. When done remember where it came from, remove the temporary code and put back the original code. ## I am not a lawyer but as far as I know the laws written in natural language - expressive enough I suppose - and still require tons of comments such that their meaning is better transported or understood. I think that it shall be allowed to comment computer code that is on a certain level comparable too.There are some languages that include commenting on a more semantic way. Clearness as concept is also difficult to grasp as the reader might have different ideas of understanding. ## 2 reasons.Comments tell WHY the programmer did it like that. Good code is usually clear enough to know WHAT it does.A high level language that will be close to reading human language will require so many lines of code it would make the effort futile. ## Have you ever looked at a piece of code that someone else wrote and said “why the F** did they do it that way?”If not then you haven’t been coding long enough.If so then you will understand why comments are necessary..There have been dozens of attempts to make coding syntax appear more like English and BASIC is probably the most famous of the early attempts.However, it ultimately failed to dominate the market because people prefer to use a language that allows them to write as compact a code as possible.. this is so that they don’t have to type so much and also because more code can fit on the screen at once which make the entire function much easier to understand.Comments are only necessary if they assist the reader in understanding why something was done that way. (i.e. the thought processes of the original author) if they don’t assist you in understanding the code better then they are entirely superfluous. ## Let’s turn the question around. You should strive to write code that is as clear as possible so that you don’t need comments. Of course you can’t avoid comments completely. But I’d much rather read clear code than some convoluted spaghetti code that you’re proud of, along with your comments explaining why it’s so cool.If you work on a team, act like it–write clear code. But by all means comment when necessary, especially docstrings for your Python functions and classes. ## Because your code should not only be obvious what it is doing but only the intent of it. And communicating intent is not always easy, or even possible, to do. ## Over the last 20 years I have seen comments move from the line and loop to the function definition for the most part. What changed? Tools become more flexible in handling long names and editors got easier to use. With that people started to write their code in smaller more expressive units. You needed to know how to call the function, and if you had to fix or extend it the code wasn't bad.This boundary and trade offs have always been there, but the change in tech has really shifted us. Our functions are overall shorter as or languages have gotten more expressive (although a lot of libraries have made simple things hard, but that's about question). Finer grain division of labor with smaller functions is more excepted today. It's easier to do with modern told and easier to work with. The old role of thumb of covering up the left side of a print out and understanding the code from the comments doesn't make sense anymore. ## The very fact that people using comments to describe the code is wrong. commenting what a class does or a function does, it can still be acceptable. Every language is clear.for example, in java,//this is a function that adds the two values and return itint funA(int x,int y) {return x+y; }Vsint addValues(int first, int second) {return first+second;}and that is the basic idea. Write it clean and readable, you don’t need comments, unless they are explaining the class or file in whole of what it does, NOT how it does.how about a new example that does the following equ: f(x) = x^2+0.15x+2500;I would write it like this.//This class solves x^2 + 0.15x+2500class EquationSolver implements Solver{private double constant = 2500;private double coefficient = 0.15;double getSqure(double value) {return value*value;}private double getCoeValue(double value){return coefficient * value;}@Overridepublic double calculate(double value) {double squared = getSquare(value);double coeVal = getCoeValue(value);return squared + coeVal + constant;}}public interface Solver{public double calculate(double value);}I believe you don’t need to use comments for the code. ## Code that is clearly written and readable generally does not need comments.However, in some instances, code may be written to address unusual or exceptional circumstances. Then you need to explain yourself: Why is this code necessary? What is the context?The objective of comments is to provide continuity of understanding. As you read the code, you should be able to follow the natural logical flow. If there are any surprises, they need to be clarified.Overall, you should expect fairly few comments in your code base. But real-world software projects can never (or should never) be 100% comment-free. ## So simple. :)Comments are supposed to help us understand code (a) when its user documentation is useless; and (b) when we’re trying to maintain it.Unfortunately most of the time in my experience comments:don’t reveal the underlying theory for a code (otherwise knows as the algorithm, preferably in the form of an academic paper or other such document), andthey make it a lot more difficult to follow the meaning of the code, at the same time they rarely revealing anything significant about it as in ‘here I calculate the size of my munging.’Since current high level languages are plenty good enough at enabling us to name and structure stuff my preference is for comments only where we would want to know what an awfully ‘clever’ programmer has done with the really arcane features of a language in a single line of a mere 354 characters. ## Beyond commenting on how a piece of code works, which is very important if a performance-optimized bit of mathematical code is no longer easy to understand (an unfortunately common occurrence), I use the comments to make references either to source material for the hardware that I’m writing for, or our own architectural and implementation documentation that we generate as part of our design process.That is, a bit of code might have a comment that says /* To understand how this bit works, see TI GPIO User’s Guide - SPRUGHB/Table 2–1 */. Another bit of code might be commented like this: /* Reference Agile #P12763 on dynamic range considerations for these calculations, and why the decision was taken to use Radix 19 math throughout */.Some of the hardware references and offsets might be expected to be enshrined in a nice .h file somewhere, but you can enshrine behavior in a macro, and even then, you’d need to know which manual a set of register/bit defines came from.I’m a fan of having tons of documentation. Basically, any time you’ve written something that isn’t immediately obvious from a glance by a good coder, you need to explain what you did and why you did it that way. It’s not a mark of a good coder to be the one guy who could ever understand some arcane function.And arcane mathematical functions are very normal in my world. I had one piece of code a couple years back that was written in linear assembly for a TI DSP. No comments at all, single-letter variable names. It took me a day to take apart a 12-line method to figure out that it was a 3rd-order Newton-Raphson approximation to 1/n. In other words, something that desperately needed a few lines of comment, and maybe an equation or two.As it happened, for that particular piece of code, I knew what company that coder had gone to, so I was able to track him down and make fun of his sloppiness.Why not comment? The code won’t run any faster if the source code has lots of comments, and it’s not like saving disk space by keeping your source files short is a priority for anyone. ## Each and every project implemention code is in n number of lines and if another programmer see that code it don't understand any thing and its very difficult for that code developer for ramainber which code is for what purpose so comments are must in all languages codeFor small code like for mini projects its OK it doesn't required. But five comment to each line of code is the good habit of good programmer . ## As good a language could get to becoming incredibly clear on what is being done it will be the why. Silly example but it will never say, “I have to do XYZ because of an error in the API that wont be fixed…. grrrr”. ## The programming language is not English (or whatever your native language might be). Comments are to explain to humans the algorithm being used, why one procedure is being used over another and pretty much anything else about that code that might not be obvious. ## Even in human language some thoughts and concepts require additional explanations of what is or was meant. Most of the time do you know who most benefits from comments? The original programmer to remind him/her what they were tryingto achieve in tha block of code. If you are looking for the most human reading language IMO Ruby is about the closest you will get. Python is close but I think Ruby has it beat. The good news is that a more capable language written in the style of Ruby is coming. Its being built to be more multipurpose, faster and more concurrent than Ruby while following a good deal of Ruby syntax - Crystal"

A trivial way is to use a binary diffing utility.2This utility is used in a similar way as plaintext code comparison listing. Due to the fact that executable programs have been translated into binary machine code, reading the output of a binary diff tends to be a more complex task.Another binary file comparison technique relies on the introduction and use of cryptographic hash algorithms. This comparison technique is based upon computing and comparing signatures from both datasets and/or specific byte streams offsets within those datasets analyzed.In summary, a cryptographic hash function such as MD5,3 is an algorithm that given an arbitrary dataset as input, will apply mathematical methods to produce a single “signature” based on each and every byte of the dataset. Due to the function mathematical property known as being referentially transparent, if the hash algorithm is called twice on input that is ""equal"" (for example, two files that consist of the same sequence of characters) it will produce the same result. The smallest modification, of just one character would lead to a completely different “signature.”Applying these elements in a real world scenario means that if two files being compared (for example, two executable files) are equal, their hashing signatures must be the same. As a result we can use hashing comparison to identify copied text. When analyzing multiple files, a list of hash results loaded and sorted in a spread sheet can be used to determine identical files.The process of converting source code to binary machine code translation is known as compilation. Compilation takes into account many elements such as the target machine processor, operating system, optimization techniques, and additional information that can be added to the program executable to debug it later. As a result, using different compiler software tools leads to different formatted executable files.Since hash algorithms comparison technique computes the signatures from a specific byte stream within a file, the result using this technique can return completely different hashes on different generated binary files. It may well happen that two functionally identical binary files coming from the same source code do not match each other’s hash signature. Again, source code obfuscation or encoding techniques render the hash algorithm comparison useless to detect almost but not completely exact files. After the compilation process, there are multiple binary scrambling and encryption tools available that allow encoding of a program file, keeping it completely functional and executable.In conclusion, binary file analysis by both binary diffing and cryptographic hash signatures comparison is a very limited approach to identify source code being re-used.” ## Depending on the toolchain used and the target binary format, this is likely caused by some kind of metadata included in the output. Some possibilities include: a revision/version number, a compilation timestamp, a NONCE."
"/What-is-the-origin-and-rationale-of-the-C++-coding-style-of-having-no-space-after-an-if-or-for"," Coding Style,  Readability (software),  C++ (programming language)","What is the origin and rationale of the C++ coding style of having no space after an ""if"" or ""for""?","I did it deliberately. For me, I thought it made the code more readable. As I remember, I thought it might help me as I was quickly scanning code to differentiate between statements that use parentheses for syntactic purposes, and expressions that use parentheses to influence order of operations with data. On some projects I put spaces between layers of parentheses inside expressions with operators, and spaces between the parentheses and what they enclosed, again in an attempt to make the code more readable.I don't remember IDEs creating code where the parentheses butted up against what they followed, except for function prototypes. ## Some people lack basic typesetting skills. Language constructs shall be visually distinguishable from function calls. Lack of space between ""if"" or ""for"" and the following opening bracket reminds me of people who put punctuation marks together with the first letter of the following word as opposed to keeping it with the last letter of the previous word."
"/I-dont-use-comments-in-my-code-Is-that-okay"," Code Comments,  Personal Question","I don't use comments in my code. Is that okay?","Probably NOT, but it depends.Comments are over-recommended when what is needed is code that is SO CLEAR it requires few if any comments.Whenever you are doing something that is not crystal clear to anyone who knows the language you should comment that code.This means you should write very few comments to “explain the language” — if that is needed you either don’t know the language well or you are using it badly.But for most of us - humans - we need to do things whose MEANING is not entirely clear simply from understanding the language.These things should be explained.We really don’t need a comment block to say “This is a function, and here are it’s parameters” — that should be implicit and the names you choose should make it exceedingly clear.However, explaining what is required to call that function, what the parameter restrictions and requirements are, plus what will be returned is frequently important.If you are writing crappy code that has “side-effects” not directly assigned to the responsibility of a function then this darn (insert stronger word here) should be explained — or better, rewritten.(E.g., if you have a function whose job is to write to a database that is an inherent function but if you call a function to calculate PI and it changes things all over your program or database that is abhorrent. STOP THAT!)Using better names is important but this does not always mean using longer names — though longer names frequently are PART of the solution — using specific wording is more important than counting letters.Also note when the name of something needs an “AND” or refers to a whole pile of things it is probably a poor function or entity. (Ignoring things that natural fit together but then typically there is a good name for THAT instead.)Using good ENGLISH (or your language) and GOOD X-programming language in combination makes the best code.Explain what *YOU* will not understand 2 years from now if you don’t look at this code.BUT BETTER, write code that is so clear that ANYONE (who knows your language, computer and natural) will understand as much as possible immediately. ## If code is only for your consumption, then you should code it however best meets your needs. If being able to read the code easily is important to you, and you read it more easily without comments, then by all means. I’ve met professional coders who say if you have to comment the code, it’s too complicated.If you’re coding as part of a group, whether at work, school, or on a project with friends, then you should follow whatever the standards are for the code. Ideally someone who reads the code shouldn’t be able to tell that more than one person worked on it: it looks like a homogeneous source file.For almost all the groups I’ve worked in, there have been coding standards requiring a certain amount of commenting, especially to describe classes, interfaces, and complex pieces of code.Me, I like comments. But I’m not you. Do what works best for you, and what makes the most sense in your situation. ## No, it’s not OK. And there is no “depends” about this.Now, it’s easier for you to just read the code. And next week. And next month. Two years from now, you will look at your own code and say “what the f*ck was I doing here? what’s this supposed to do? where is this routine called from?” Because you no longer keep this code or even this app’s architecture in your head. You have moved on. You have forgotten. And now it will take you 3–4 times as long to figure it out and make the changes needed.And that’s just you. Now think about a different programmer that may need to maintain your code. He doesn’t think like you. He’s never seen your code before. He’s never worked on this application. He has absolutely no clue why you wrote what you wrote. And, if you use different naming conventions, that makes it even more confusing. And if you happen to have solved a tricky problem in a particularly creative way, and didn’t comment *exactly* what you did and why — forget it, the next person to touch that code will probably end up spending hours to totally re-write it.Comments are your friend! No matter how “self-documenting” your code may be — there is no substitute for a good header comment and lots and lots of in-line “one-liners” that tell the story.So make little comments as you code, and then, after you are done, spend the extra 15–20 minutes to go over it and make more comments to make the story flow. This will save you hours and hours of time in the future. ## Documentation serves several purposes:To implement conventions so that certain forms are always present. This ensures that various things are always described and that information has a consistent appearance.To explain the function of code on a local basis.To explain why particular code is present.The first of these, while of utility, certainly leads to a lot of boilerplate and can often get in the way.The next is only helpful to code readers who need assistance in how the computer language accomplishes its task. This should be used only when constructs are inherently “thick”.The last case is the most vital: recording why. When this is neglected vital information is lost. Someone reading such code at a later time will not know the reason for taking that path…and, perhaps more importantly, why others were not. BTW, “someone” includes you!So while it is possible (and, indeed, a primary goal) to write code pure, beautiful, and concise enough to be functionally self-documenting, this by itself does not suffice. ## If you *never* comment your code, you’ll find in a year or two that your code that you thought was so clear wasn’t as much as you thought.But, there’s a big gap between never commenting anything and commenting every line (also a no-no). How much you need to comment your code comes down to coding style, but I comment with the assumption that someone is going to come in a year after I’m gone, doing forensics through my codebase. I comment to explain that a given function meets business requirements in some way or other, or I comment to explain a particular optimization that isn’t strictly necessary for logic but aids smooth running. I comment major functional elements, e.g. complex processes that interact with multiple subsystems, even if the actual interaction with those subsystems is further broken down into purpose built and well named methods.Commenting is a skill and a habit. What I hear you saying, and what I said when I was new to this practice, is that you’re bad at it and the payoff doesn’t seem to be worth the effort to get good at it. You’ll find that it *is* worth the effort, and when you’re good at it, you’re a much better developer. ## The problem with comments is that they get out dated with changes.//This function does blah. Parameters x = x positionvoid blah(int x) { };Versus code that can be refactored within an IDE with no comments.void DrawSpaceship(int xPosition, int yPosition) {}Simple example, because x & y are obvious there, but it’s just been better for me if the code is the comment.Sometimes a nice explanation of what is going on before the function helps, but naming variables and functions properly really helps.If you have a function that calculates sales tax, name it that. But if it’s hard to name or it’s something odd, put a little description above it. Skip the variable names in comments like visual studio wants you to describe - they don’t update if you refactor via the IDE.Comments get old, and they don’t get compiled. I just keep that in mind. ## Here’s the test…Write some horribly complex code - don’t comment it. Now come back in 3 years and take a look at it - if you can’t understand EXACTLY what you did in under 2 minutes without fault, you might need some comments…Test #2…Write some moderately complex code. Have a colleague dissect it. If they can’t understand exactly what you did in under 2 minutes, you might need some comments…Test #3…Write some moderately complex code. Get half drunk, go to bed. Startle yourself awake at 2am, force yourself to understand and debug your code in under 5 minutes, of you can’t do it, you might need some comments… (this is what an early morning crappy call out feels like - I had one 3 days ago just like this)And finally, if you want a job in a real development studio, comment your code, or you’ll be marched out the door in short time.Always comment…When you’ve been run down dead by a bus, it may save the next guy from eternally cursing your good name. ## YES.If your code is “readable” (made with meaningful names) than yes. Comment will be a useless repetition that -like all repetition- tends to become inconsistent with time.If you see something likefor(int i=0; i<500; ++i) // count up-to 100you’ll never know if the error is in the counter or in the comment and even if it’s or not “off by one” (“up-to” … should it include the end or not?). So a comment like that is pure rubbish.It would have been much better to explain why 500 and not 501 or 9999. But to “explain that”, just give a name to itfor(int i=0; i<max_selection; ++i)____________Comment becomes important not to “explain the code” (note: I assume the reader of the code knows the language in which it is written), but to explain its organizationfor(int i=0; i<max_selection; ++i) // see ""config.h""Or to explain relevant design decision//   config.h /// \file: symbolic constant used across general code./// Placed in an inline namespace to allow direct use,/// and protect from eventual future conflicts. inline namespace user_interface_constants{    ...     /// Maximum selection limit.    /// - selection rarely goes over 200.    /// - can be negative if reversed.    int max_selection = 500;         ...} ## No, It’s not OK! You are considered a Cowboy programmer who is ploughing through 100’s of lines of code but not considering the outcome of your code after it worked. Any software needs maintenance and its not a given that you are the one who is going to manage this when there is a bug or an enhancements. these are the following problems of an uncommented codeIt takes time to understand your code by reviewing it first (comments get you quick intro on what a block of code is doing).Documentation is precious when you do RCA (Root cause analysis) or impact analysis of an enhancements. ## That’s subjective my friend, I believe you must be doing reviews for code that others have written. Now imagine you reading few lines of code and just checking the syntactic sugar without even getting a hint of what is the programmer intending to do. You would not be okay with it, right?Now to keep it simple that is what you are doing to others by not giving your code proper comments.Another angle to this is, a good programmer can surely make out by reading code even if you miss out on your comments but then how much more the reviewer can feel good about your code to see a few word of comments that can make life simpler. At the end if the day all of us want to get things done easy and quick \U0001f60a ## If you are coding in a vacuum - it’s code only you will ever see, and it’s not for an employer - then sure. DO what you like. If you are working for a company then absolutely not. Someone will have to come after you to clean up any errors or modify your code. And part of your job is those comments. It’s not just a good idea. It’s pretty much a job requirement. ## Its good practice to use identifying comments, not just for you later, but for future programmers in the company who will come along later and need to adjust the code for a future need. It is a sign of good programming to inherently document the work, so future teams can ramp up, or adjust the code to suit management of the day.Tnink of it as a stamp of excellence! Like signing your painting, or autographing your novel. Do it well, and your peers will know who did the good work! ## if your are writing many lines of code, its good to use comments in other to look for where you implemented a particular action especially if most lines look similar.plus if you also work with a team, it also good so your partners can understand your code while reading it.but even if you don’t meet the above requirements, it is better you start commenting so just to get used to it because some day, you would have to write lengthy codes and work with teams ## It depends. I try to make my procedures short and to the point. So that the name of the procedure is self documenting and becomes a comment in itself. Functions should not have side effects and do what the name implies. If I do anything that is tricky and not self evident, I comment and explain what I’m doing. Also the unit test is another form of documentation, you are unit testing right?I write code thinking that the person who has to maintain my code knows where I live, and has a gun. ## I find that sometimes code actually makes it less readable. One tip I learned is to only comment “WHY” your code does something.Never comment what it’s doing.Example:A function that returns the area of a beer can.Don’t explain how it calculates the area (pi r^2 * height).Explain WHY - i.e. product labels are cut to 1.25x beer can area. ## It’s a dilemma. When I am in flow I don’t want to interrupt a non-verbal though process to write about it. Six months later when I am reverse-engineering myself I wish I had.I try to make the code as self-documenting as possible. I know my own style and habits, and no one else has to maintain or modify what I write. If they did I would imagine they’d be pretty irritated.For me the best method is to write up a detailed process description beforehand and copy relevant portions into the code. ## Mark Twain said about a letter he wrote: “I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.”That’s how I feel about comments. If I have to comment, it means my code is not simple or clear enough. ## Many automated documentation systems rely on comments. Further, depending on your application purpose, comments often allow the research to be reproduced."

There is an interesting review of all these conventions written by Rasmus Bååth: The State of Naming Conventions in R .Let me quote an extract from the article, which is a good candidate for the answer:Most programming languages have official naming conventions, official in the sense that they are issued by the organization behind the language and accepted by its users.

SQL is good at allowing you as a developer, to seamlessly join (or merge) several data together. Combining data from multiple tables is a key strength.However, SQL isn’t designed for manipulating or transforming data into other formats.

"/Why-a-unified-code-style-matters"," Coding Style,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Why a unified code style matters?","I'd say there are two main reasons to enforce a unified code format in a project.First has to do with version control: with everybody formatting the code identically, all changes in the files are guaranteed to be meaningful. No more just adding or removing a space here or there, let alone reformatting an entire file as a ""side effect"" of actually changing just a line or two.The second reason is that it kind of takes the programmers' egos out of the equation. With everybody formatting their code the same way, you can no longer as easily tell who has written what. The code becomes more anonymous and common property, so nobody needs to feel uneasy about changing ""somebody else's"" code. ## The importance of code style is proportional to the size of the team and the maturity of the codebase. That is, for a new project or MVP being developed by three people the style of code is relatively unimportant. This is for 2 reasonsThere is a small number of people so the conflicting styles will be small in number at worstAt this stage the product is not even in market, so there's no point fighting over tabs vs spaces, because for all you know no one will even use the product.Think of it like an artist drawing a face. The first step is just an oval, she doesn't worry about shading the earlobe, ie the fine details. Just get the base object created.

"/Can-a-float-be-used-in-a-switch-case-in-C"," C++ (programming language),  C (programming language),  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Can a float be used in a switch case in C?","C99 specification, 6.8.4.2, paragraph 1:The controlling expression of a switch statement shall have integer type.Paragraph 3 of the same section:The expression of each case label shall be an integer constant expression…There is no provision for using floating point expressions of any kind to control a switch statement. That being said, both the controlling expression and the case labels can be floating point numbers which have been cast to an integer type, but I can’t say that I’ve ever seen that happen. For the controlling expression, you risk undefined behavior if the floating point number is outside of the integer range. For the case labels, it’s hard to imagine a legitimate reason for casting a floating point constant to an integer and testing an integer against it for equality. This would be legal, but stretches the limits of usefulness:#define PI 3.14159 enum relation_to_PI {  NEAR_POSITIVE_PI,  NEAR_NEGATIVE_PI,  NOT_NEAR_PI}; enum relation_to_PIclassify(float N) {  // Example of how switch statement should NOT be used.  switch ((int)N) {    case (int)PI:      return NEAR_POSITIVE_PI;    case (int)(-PI):      return NEAR_NEGATIVE_PI;    default:      return NOT_NEAR_PI;  }}But that’s an abomination which should never actually be used except as an example of how C can be misused, and which exhibits undefined behavior for many input values (if the conversion from float to int overflows the integer range). ## You wouldn’t want to use a float or double in a switch statement because of the rounding error. In other words, 3.14 may not equal 3.14 all of the time. You should wire a function that takes two floats and a third argument which indicates the maximum difference. If the two numbers are within a certain tolerance they are treated as equal. This would then have to be used in an “if” statement rather than a switch. ## No, that is not allowed. The expression used in a switch statement must have an integral or enumerated type. The constant-expression for a case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch. It must be a constant or a literal. ## No but you do can do a comparison strategy by subtracting the floats and using that subtraction result to run specific code:int sub_result = (int) (flval1 - flval2);if( sub_result > 0 ) {	/// code if greater than} else if( sub_result <= -1 ) {	/// code if less than} else {	/// code if equal.}"

"/What-are-some-alternatives-to-C-for-high-speed-calculation"," C++ (programming language),  C (programming language),  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","What are some alternatives to C for high speed calculation?","At one time one would say that if you want high speed calculation, you should avoid interpreted languages like Ruby and anything running on the JVM or .NET. This still may be true for absolutely the fastest calculation possible, but interpreters like JVM essentially compile the program to excellent machine code at runtime; they can get you so close to ‘fastest’ that there is no need to go to another language. Fast enough delivered next week is often better than ‘fastest’ possible 14 months from now.Conventional wisdom says use C and C++ compiled with gcc for speed. Clang (C, C++, C) compiles faster than gcc and uses LLVM to produce fast code. There must be cases where one is better than the other but I don’t know them.FORTRAN and ADA both use gcc or LLVM depending on vintage. They both generate fast code. Fast numeric code is FORTRAN’s reason for being. ADA was designed to be optimizer friendly as well as portable across many different and sometimes weird CPUs.GO and Rust are both low level languages (like C) but prevent many programmer mistakes. Both are fast.Unoptimized Haskell code can set records for slowness; but if you turn on the optimizer Haskell (as compiled by ghc) can almost equal hand coded C (occasionally faster than C.) ## These days, any compiled language should produce similar code for “complicated” calculations on relatively simple CPUs. Even for interpreted languages, “calcuation” speed is more likely to be dependent on hardware (whether there is floating point hardware, and how much it does, specialized co-processing (vector, graphics and DSP instructions) and library quality, rather than the language itself.Highly specialized hardware may require specialized languages or libraries. For example, there is CUDA for dealing with NVidia GPUs.Fortran still has a reputation for doing heavy math especially well; apparently it has been more aggressive at adding complex math (complex numbers, matrix calculations, parallelism) directly to the language instead of relying on add-on libraries.Remember that algorithm performance can be expressed astime = implementationDepdentConstant * AlgorithmDependentFunction( problemSize)Using a “better” language only affects the constant multiplier, which has diminishing returns compared to using better algorithms. ## “What are some alternatives to C for high speed calculation?”C and C++ are really good at interacting with the hardware, but just to feed the coprocessor or vector processor with data and store the result, you don’t need them.Any language could do fine, for example Python. There are many high quality, detailed answers on Quora, demonstrating the concept. The language does not matter. How is the code structured, whether it can use multiple cores or the graphics accelerator, does matter. ## For languages, you’d look at C, C++, Fortran, Julia, OCaml and Haskell, depending on the problem domain.But you’ll also have to look into what libraries exist in your problem domain and what their requirements are.And if you are doing something that doesn’t fit on one machine, your cluster operating system is going to require things that will likely decide your language choice for you. ## FORTRAN would be a good option given the fact that there are many physics and engineering libraries for it. It translates well to assembler language. Actually, if you know assembler you can read the machine code through the FORTRAN syntax. ## Depends on what your trying to do.If you’re trying to shave off fractions of a second of computation time for a relatively simple algorithm, then you might want to look at Assembly, i.e. if your architecture supports that.If you dealing with large datasets, then you will want to look at parallelizing your code. This can be done on CPUs and/or GPUs, using a variety of techniques/languages including CUDA, OpenCL, pragma injections, etc… ## Fortran.Yes, Fortran is still the primary languages for scientific computing.Why physicists still use FortranComputing in Science: Fortran outlasts them all - While hardware technology proceeds apace, scientists still battle away with Fortran programming / Why not look at more modern computer languages?https://www.researchgate.net/pos... ## Fortran is apparently still popular and fast for calculations.

"/Are-design-patterns-bad"," Software Design Patterns,  Object-Oriented Design Patterns,  Software Design,  Patterns,  Java (programming language),  Design,  Software Engineering,  Software and Applications,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Are design patterns bad?","It depends on project size.A small project would benefit little from having design patterns used everywhere. An extreme case is a “Hello, world!” example — simply printing the string directly will suffice; one doesn’t need to create an App class with a Run method and all that.As projects get larger, patterns help keep code reusable and organized, and easier to reason about. But the paradox (and/or irony) is that, in addition to having to know one’s language of choice, one must also learn the patterns and their APIs. The same is true of any libraries or other middleware; the surface area of the knowledge domain must increase to include them. I still remember the fierce resistance my coworkers had to using a report printing library I developed — they were already familiar with Visual Basic’s “Print” command.Game developers could be forgiven for hating the complexity of Unreal Engine. It uses patterns everywhere, and tons of delegate mechanisms and pure virtual classes (interfaces) to avoid tight coupling. Its API surface area is enormous and coders often complain that finding the code that does something involves traipsing through countless layers of alien-looking function calls and mysterious procedures.But UE is overkill for small games (unless you’re already comfortable with it); it was built to handle the problems faced by those making large games: managing tons of assets, organizing gameplay and controller logic, integrated UI, modeling and animation tools, etc.What developers have to appreciate is that design patterns are part of the curriculum now, because computers can run large, complex programs. Games today e.g. easily outweigh operating systems, so they have to built with system languages and frameworks.One could say “But I know the problem I’m solving — I could code it directly.” That may be true, but one needs to accept that writing such code is not the entire problem. We were able to get away with it in the early PC days when all we had was 64K or 640K of RAM, but today, everything is much larger. ## According to every new programmer you may hire—they will all claim all of them before they come along were beyond badly designed. Then after a few weeks of wrecking what was beyond their thinking abilities, It is then that the Bosses have to fall back to their own Legacy code after firing the Supposed Expert.All design patterns are bad. All of them. But they all work, and you simply cannot go in thinking you can make something better of what someone else or a team had established long before the new guy or girl comes along. Not before or through thorough testing can anything be approved either.Examples:Yahoo— Attempted to switch from Flat Filed Php to a Oop Php Framework, The creater of Php had to go in and rewrite their entire code base to fix it back to flat filed.DropBox—Tried to switch from Python 2.5–2.7 to 3.5–3.6–3.7 Guido assisted and it took a team a year or two to fix.FaceBook— Similar to Yahoo, they attempted to switch over to a Php Framework from Flat Filed Php and had to revert —it failed miserably.The C++ Computer Language. Clearly a language not planned by an average Human. And dare anyone learn it fully ! I would guess Bernie plays Chess —because C++ has as many traps as a Chess game can have. Lol ## Like a good subroutine or object library, design patterns are about reuse.Unlike the first two, which let a programmer reuse code written by others, design patterns let the programmer (or software architect) reuse the THINKING that resulted in a successful solution. Assume you are trying to overcome a problem unrelated to the specifics of your application:Ex: an over-sensitivity to enterprise policy (how a bank calculates its interest payments, how many days a library patron can check items out, etc.) is causing repeated modifications to the code.There is a design pattern (the policy object) that encapsulates those frequent changes behind the interface of an object which accepts a key (“DaysOut”) and returns the current value for that site at that time. How it does it (local table, site config file) can change without affecting any other code in the application.So what is bad about that? Here’s the (free) PDF of the book which originally standardized the documentation of such patterns, and which has most of the really interesting ones.http://www.uml.org.cn/c++/pdf/de...It’s a great reference … you look in the index to see if an applicable design pattern exists for the problem you are having."

Which constitutes “the program printing itself”, because the source-code file is an empty file.Or, if one construes “no input” to mean “no input other than the source-code file of the program being executed”, that’s easy. Since the easiest way to print the contents of computer-program source-code file is the BASH command “cat”, the simplest example of a self-printing program would be a BASH shell script stored in a file named “self-print.sh”, with this content:cat 'self-print.sh'Or, if by “no input” one means “no input to the program, including no accessing of its own source file”, then things become much harder. Such a self-printing non-source-file-accessing program is called a “quine”, and quines are bloody difficult to write, because while it is easy to write a program that prints some of its own source code, it is much harder to write a program that prints all of its own source code, because a print command is always outside the thing to be printed. However, quines can be written in most languages. For example, here is a quine (program that prints itself without accessing its own source file) written in Perl:$s = q(print qq(\$s = q($s);eval \$s;));eval $s; ## You can use string formatting. Here is a simple example in Python:foo = 'foo = %r; print(foo%%foo)'; print(foo%foo)This program first defines foo to be the specified string literal, then prints the content of foo replacing any occurrence of %r with the value of foo.Here is a similar but slightly more complicated program in C:#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h> const char *foo = ""#include <stdio.h>%c#include <stdlib.h>%c%cconst char *foo = %c%s%c;%c%cint main(){%c    printf(foo, 10, 10, 10, 34, foo, 34, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10);%c    return 0;%c}""; int main(){    printf(foo, 10, 10, 10, 34, foo, 34, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10);    return 0;}The idea is the same, but %s in printf doesn’t include the quotes, so we need to find another way of including the quotes. We do that by replacing the quotes with %c (which converts a number to its ASCII character) and writing the corresponding number (34) as a parameter for printf. We do the same to escape the newlines (ASCII code 10).Other languages like Javascript have features which makes it possible to do this much mor easily. In Javascript, converting a function to a string outputs that function’s code. So you can easily define a function which prints its own code (including its definition), then call the function at the end of the program and add a string literal inside the function corresponding to that:function foo(){    console.log(foo + ""\nfoo();"");}foo();This makes it a lot easier since you don’t need to worry about escaping newlines, quotes and other special characters, and you can easily add other commands and comments inside the function without needing to change anything anywhere else. ## Oh, this is an old puzzle posed to programmers for generations. I won’t give away the answer because in the course of solving it you will find yourself - yes you! - recreating the heart of Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem and the Church-Turing thesis. The act of solving it is an unexpectedly rich intellectual treasure trove.I’ll give you a hint: You are going to need the fact that alphanumeric characters can be converted to an integer (their ASCII value.)Aside from that, there’s nothing magic going on. It’s just strings and print statements and some clever substitutions.Have at it and return to it if you fail. It’s worth it.When you succeed, go look up how Godel constructed his ‘G’ and something called ‘quines’. You will find yourself in the company of immortals. ## All computer languages can do this. And do it in several ways. It is extremely easy. 1. First make a text copy of your program file—-paste it into an EOF string, assign a variable to it and use a file handler to write it to a file of your choice. It will execute when you click on the .exe file and make another copy of itself to your target file and extension you give it. You can also direct the file path to a compiler of choice with your program likewise.2. Have your program open and read its own named file IN BINARY with extension—if the file is not there simply break out. Have it do the above by writing what it reads to another file. Then whatever file placed into the programs directory is placed there so when run it will make a SHADOW copy. If it is already compiled it will still run, but you may want to place it in a different path OR DIRECTORY while writing it.But you can save yourself allot of time by simply creating Windows Batch .bat files to do everything you wish and more. Then using Windows built in Package Creator called iexpress.exe and convert these batch to .exe. Then you can also call and execute these .bat .exe files from any language also.Batch files are after all the most dominant file and directory handlers for installing, managing and altering Bios, machine and Registry settings and or software and their packages. And they can create files, copy, move, delete, rename, move entire directories, clear cookies, clear the DNS cache, clear and clean the registry, set bios settings and install packages or files from online as well. And batch has user input also to alloow asking questions to conditionally perform instructions also.As with above have a single batch file as an .exe when clicked make an entire copy of your entire application with all of its files and directories and install it as a copy. ## well here is an answer most of you won't like:this is NOT possible at all. executing code is at machine level, and there is no link back to the source code. the only way any program could produce a copy of its own source code (or any code), is to INPUT the code from its file. ## I’m gonna go with the mighty PHP on this one:<?php echo file_get_contents(__FILE__);And that’s it. __FILE__ refers to the file you are coding in, file_get_contents reads a file into a stream, and echo outputs. ## The following won the prize for “Worst Abuse of the Rules” in the international obfuscated C contest:                                                                     `The source code is empty and the program outputs nothing.

But on Monday after doing my other responsibilities (I wasn’t a programmer at this job) I came to “my” computer and opened up the VBA macro editor. This was the line:(mess of crap here) ' To Future Jim: JUST FUCKING TRUST ME, OKAY?!I read the line and had absolutely no idea what in hell I thought I was doing.

When we confronted him about this he said he did not like to program (he was a senior about to get a B.S. in Computer Science). He told us at that time that he was only taking the course because of his student loans and that he had already been suspended once for low GPA. When we asked him what he was going to do if he was not doing computer science he said either a disk jockey or a forest ranger (Needless to say we realized we were not going to get help from him).We told him he had to do the trainScheduling method since he was not doing any of the other classes or methods.

His comments where he waxed up his achievements and his authoring the method took one of those screens. We put it in and since I am good at code testing I quickly tested it. It did not work on half the test cases. I printed out his method and annotated the failed conditions and told him to fix it. We then went to class where I got a brief extension so we could fix the method.After class this guy gave me back the “correct” code which I promptly tested. While he corrected half the errors he also broke more of the test cases. I then went through the code and commented what test case his “logic” in the method worked with and then had to search through the hundreds of lines of code to find the errors. Which I corrected one at a time and then ran the test matrix to confirm my correction did not break something else. After completing to debug I decided the effort deserved credit, but I did not want to get “credit” for the spagetti code so I added one line after his authorship line. That line which I think was the best comment ever in a code was:Debugged by the Grace of God: Richard A. Fowlkes ## In the late 70s I was working at a company that used an Intel development system. The editor had originally been designed for use on a teletype machine. When you backspaced to delete a character, the character was printed on the paper a second time. For example, something like “cbbat” would show that the programmer deleted the ‘b’ to end up with “cat”. Meanwhile, everyone had moved on to CRT terminals, but this behavior continued.Then we got a new release of the editor that took advantage of the CRT by erasing the deleted character and leaving the cursor at the character position so that you could enter the new character. The release notes stated:“Backspace now deletes character, as God intended.” ## The notorious original scheduler code comment in the Linux kernel (linux/kernel/sched.c)Linus Torvalds uses a goto instruction as a hack to get better assembly code from the C compiler. And then he closes the comment with:/*  * Dijkstra probably hates me. */Linus Torvalds, Edsger Dijkstra, hateful goto instructions… You can't get more computer nerd history from any other single line of code comment! ## A very good way of providing comment lines in your code is to describe each of the variables used, the task handled by each function, what is the purpose of the class and obviously, the name of the author. Look at this sample code:As you can see I have described the task of each function in this class(in this screenshot only the parameterised constructors are shown). So when I created the javadocs for this class, it gave me a detailed summary of what a particular function does. Therefore if anybody else in my team needs to read or modify the code, he or she can understand what each variable and function stands for: ## Fairly recently I found a comment that I must have written at the bottom of some code in a project I've been working on for the better part of a year. The comment read/*What did you think I would do at this moment?

In other words, pseudo code is a modeling tool. As such, it does not have the strict rules or keywords of any particular programming language. Rather, it is an arbitrary mixture of words and punctuation that are common to many programming languages and natural languages as well (e.g if, else, for, while, and, or, not).

Some coders may find it hard to read.","*Edit: K&R style is actually the second one below, my mistake. They're likely just used to it from C.*As an advocate for K&R style braces, I don’t find it hard to read at all. It’s probably popular because it’s how C’s de-facto style guide did it, and C’s style inspired a lot of languages. And because the other methods are stupid (he said impartially).So our options are:myFunc() {	//Stuff} or myFunc(){	//Stuff} or myFunc() {	//Stuff}The first is K&R style, the other two are increasingly stupid (In my neutral opinion). K&R style clearly associates the opening bracket with the thing it’s opening for, and doesn’t waste a line needlessly.The second style isn’t too bad, but I feel like it wastes a line for no real reason.The third style actually saves us a line which the other two don’t, but the closing bracket is easy to miss there next to a semicolon (Which most C-style languages end statements with), and I personally hate it.At the end of the day, you should get used to a couple different styles, and use whatever your team is using. I don’t think language-standard style is too important as long as its clear and consistent (E.g. You could use the second or- god forbid -the third style in C). ## I need to admit this. I had to check the other answers to know what the K&R style of braces is. As per my understanding now, it is like this.void myFunc(){	doStuff();}Then I had to read the question again. Something still seems wrong. It is the easiest style to read, according to me. I mean, just look at it. It clearly tells you what block it is, and also indentation tells you where it is closed. I find the other alternative harder to read, and it is also longer as long as lines of code are concerned. Not that this is a serious issue, but it sure makes reading harder.void myFunc(){	doStuff();}This seems to be your preferred way, and I find it too hard to read. In fact, I develop and automatic sense of superiority over someone who uses this (incorrect I know, but I am a human).This is an evidence that not all are like you. Some do find other styles harder, and hence this style is existent. ## It’s based on the notion that a programming language will be more readily adopted if it syntactically resembles another language that has been around for decades and is most widely used and is known to a great many people. Familiarity breeds ease of learning, or so the theory goes.There’s nothing inherently special about braces. A language can just as well use square brackets, which are better because you don’t even have to press the Shift key on the same keys as the braces! Such a language exists, too. It’s called Smalltalk: see Smalltalk and the Future of the Software Industry.In any case, brackets are more terse than using ‘begin/end’ or ‘endif’ and that saves typing. Coding efficiency is a thing, apparently. ## I think that the statement at the end of your question is key here. Some coders find it hard to read, others find the alternatives hard to read. I prefer the K&R style probably in large part because it was the style I started with. However, I would argue that it very clearly connects the statement and the block, clearly delimits the contents of the block from the rest of the code, and does so without wasting extra space."
"/Is-80-characters-per-line-a-good-constraint"," Constraint Satisfaction,  Coding Style,  Constraint Programming,  Constraints,  Computer Programming","Is 80 characters per line a good constraint?","Back in the day, we programmed using these things:80 columns.We then moved to these things:24 lines, 80 columns.Then we programmed on theseMultiple windows, of 24x80 Terminal sessions (and that's still the default on just about every windowed OS, BTW)We now have the option for doing things differently. Here's why it might be a good idea to stay with something smaller:If you find yourself needing to work remotely using equipment that's not yours, then you can always TELNET or SSH into a server, edit code, push changes. However, you're in 24x80 ""text mode"" when you do so, and if you're using conventions adapted to wider formats, it's going to be somewhere between a pain (if the text wraps) to impossible (if the text doesn't wrap) to make some changes.If you're using a sophisticated IDE, and find yourself working in a single-screen environment for some reason (like you're on your laptop, normally docked to two or three screens, except you're now in a Starbucks across the country in the middle of the night with just one screen) you will really, really want to conserve with for the text portion to allow window space for the other operant elements of the IDE you happen to be usingIf you happen to have aging eyes, then much fewer letters which are much larger is a significant win, no matter how many screens you have.In my experience, the primary place where ""man, I wish I had longer lines"" showed up was at ridiculous levels of control nesting, where indentation pushed the start of the line over a third of the way across the page. My suspicion is that your ""pushback"" is coming from people who are in this camp. It's a bad place to be. The reality is that you should have a better abstraction model which reduces the felt need for longer lines, just as a matter of course, and of making the code more readable and maintainable.On the pro side, if you're rocking a 4k screen, you feel like you can conquer the world. Width for days! High res fonts! And if you make the rules, those 1080p guys can just suck it.Watch our for that mindset. It's dangerous. ## I have relaxed max line length to 120.  I do not have a soft limit.  My reasons for the change comes mostly from how I want people to name things.  I have decided that erroring on the side of spelling things out more is in general cleaner and closer to elegant than cryptic abbreviations that may not be understood.  Longer lines facilitate this. I have also lost all interest in ridiculous ""naming standards"" with long lists of unreadable abbreviations engineers are supposed to learn and remember.I prefer code that is closer to functional or procedural than OO so I do not have a lot of nested code in our repo.  I am not quite as hard core as Linus with his discouraging indent of 8.   4 seems ok. Everyone will always have laptops with good resolution that can remote in.  Security theoretically prevents remote connections from anything other than provided laptops.  We even issue vendors laptops for short term work.  Anyone who is sight impaired will have a laptop with a screen that can see 120 at whatever resolution they like.I personally use VIM and putty almost exclusively but I encourage developers on my teams to use what ever makes them feel productive.  I can have two overlapping putty ssh sessions open at 120.   Of course at my desk on my two external monitors I will have many more.  The only thing I like an IDE for is code reviews and using some tool to analyze code for some standards like python PEP8.That said going over 120 usually implies an opportunity for more precision.   ## Is 80 characters per line a good constraint?Unless you expect a lot of people to use remote terminals restricted to a line width of 80 characters, I wouldn’t be dogmatic about it. However, I tend to set my editors to show the margin at 80 characters, and I do my best to stay within that limit. I don’t sweat about exceeding it by a few characters. A soft limit of 80 and a hard limit of 120 sounds fine to me.Why? Because line length is not primarily about fitting on the screen (though it is nice to have room for side panels for navigation, debuggers, and so on), but about making sure that lines are cognitively easy to scan. A line ought to be cognitively trivial, just as a function should be simple enough to hold in your mind at once—which is why it should not be more than a reasonable screenful; if you can’t see the whole function, I doubt you’re accurately holding it all in your mind. ## Yes.  It limits statement nesting depth which forces finer grained functions making code more understandable and robust.  It encourages clean APIs between layers over excessive indirection into sub-objects.  It facilitates coding in quiet environments for better productivity because it allows 2-3 side-by-side 80 column windows on a 14-15"" laptop.Exceptions exist on platforms with long identifiers like Windows. ## Old standards die hard (modern road lane widths derive from the standard axle width of Roman times).The 80-character limitation, of course, dates back to punched cards having eighty columns (Punched card).  Sometimes this is reflected as a 79-character  standard since one column was occasionally reserved for a continuation character.  One also sees 72 because often the last eight columns were left for sequencing (very useful when one dropped a card deck!)Eighty columns could have been chosen for various reasons.  Likely the physical properties of the card (its aspect ratio and ease of manipulation) where driving factors.  Also the typical amount of data on a lines would have been an influence: too short would result in an excessive number of cards and too long would be wasteful.  Perhaps the ability to readily comprehend what was there was also a consideration. ## Sometimes it's a little bit annoying. In my organization, we're using default 80(really 79) characters limit and sometimes I'm creating less descriptive variable names just to fit info one line. I understand reasoning behind this 80 characters limit, but sometimes it's actually hurting code readability."

"/How-can-I-add-to-a-variable-in-an-if-statement-in-python"," Coding Style,  Learning Python,  Computer Programmers,  Python (programming language),  Learning to Program,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","How can I add to a variable in an ""if statement"" in python?","As the others have attempted to show, your problem lies in the “type” of the data contained in that variable. Even though Python uses dynamic types, it uses strong types. I.e. it adjusts the type to what is input/created, but it doesn’t simply convert willy-nilly between types.What do types have to do with anything? They’re at the root of all programming. It’s because everything in a computer is actually just numbers. And types are what defines what those numbers actually “mean”.More specifically in your exact scenario, the input function reads the keystrokes the user typed in on the keyboard. This is read as a string type, a set of characters following one another. Each of these characters is a number defining a specific glyph to be shown. E.g. the 1 the user typed in may be the number 49 (in the ASCII character encoding). So what input is returning is a structure containing that 49 value as one of the characters in its set of characters.Your if statement (however) is checking if it’s the same thing as the whole number (Integer) 1. Which it isn’t.You’ve got two options (well more, but these should show how to get out of the “problem”):Convert the value returned by input to an actual number instead of a string. You can do that using the int casting function - it tries to parse a string and read it as if it was entered as a set of decimal digits.Change the comparison in the if statement to match it against a string instead of a number. You do this by quoting the 1 to tell python this is actually a string containing 1 as a character. ## Some programming languages make it easy to use a value of one type as if it were a value of another type. This is sometimes described as ""weak typing"". [1]In php, for instance, you can compare a string to an integer:if (""1"" == 1){    echo 'This line will be executed, statement evaluates to true.';} if (""1"" === 1){   echo 'This line will not be executed, because we\'re using the strict comparison operator.';}Python is a bit stricter and won’t let you do that. If we change your code to:points = 0 test = input (""test"") print(type(test))test = int(test)print (type(test)) print (points)if (test == 1): # Now we're comparing two integers!    print (""yes"")    points = points + 1 else:    print (""no"") print (points)We see that test used to be a string, after we successfully convert it to an integer you get your expected behaviour.I expect that this was already clear, but just to be sure: with int() we explicitly convert a variable to an integer[2].One of its counterparts (i.e. str()) will convert a variable to string[3]. This may come in handy when printing, since you cannot implicitly join together strings, floats and integers:floatnum = 0.5integer = 1text = ""name"" print(integer + text + floatnum)This will raise some TypeErrors (actually just one, but it would raise a second one if we converted the integer).To fix this we explicitly convert to strings by changing the last line to:print(str(integer) + text + str(floatnum))Footnotes[1] Strong and weak typing - Wikipedia[2] 2. Built-in Functions[3] 2. Built-in Functions ## Actually in Python input() takes what the user typed and passes it back as a string. So in yours code it the variable test will be assigned to “1”(a string not a int 1) if you give input as 1. So here are two things that you can do to work your code is:Check the variable test to be equal be “1” i.e.points = 0 test = input (""test"")print (points)if (test == ""1""):    print (""yes"")    points = points + 1 else:    print (""no"") print (points)Or typecast the input() as test=int(input(“test”)) if you want the variable test to be a int.points = 0 test = int(input (""test""))print (points)if (test == 1):    print (""yes"")    points = points + 1 else:    print (""no"") print (points)Hope this will help :)"

A few reflect idioms that are used in particular languages but are not popular in others. And many are OOP specific so are more easily implemented in an OOP based language. But since that includes nearly all modern languages it is not much of an issue.But a good design pattern should be applicable regardless of language because they address design issues common to all. Things like state machines, User Interfaces, error logging, dealing with hierarchical data, these apply to all languages, they are part of the problem definition, not the solution space. ## When talking about patterns as template solutions for recuring problems, there are at least three kinds, which occasionally get mixed up:Idioms are language specific programming constructs, e.g. registering callback functions in C using function pointers along with a void pointer for configuration data.Design patterns are constellations of objects and classes that typically require an object-oriented language, e.g. observer pattern or strategy pattern or compsite pattern.Architectural styles are constellations of clusters of objects and classes (a.k.a. components). They are typically even independent of a programming paradigm. Examples are layers pipes&filters, or blackboard. IMHO MVC is an architectural style and less of a design pattern, in particular since wentry to solve an architectural problem and less of a design problem."

So Google puts a lot of their utility code into open source to lower those costs. If a community of developers forms around an open source project there are likely to be contributions of big fixes, enhancements, documentation, performance improvements, unit tests, localizations (translations to other languages). All those things would have taken time for the company to do (and time = money). Same thing with Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, IBM etc ## It depends on the code.Suppose that you built a special Apache module. You might be better off open sourcing that code and, hoping to get external contributors and external awareness of your website, rather than keeping it for your website and keeping the benefits to yourself but also fully assume the continuing development and maintenance costs.In my case, I built a framework that is not the “secret sauce” of my website and I agreed to let somebody else improve it, open source it and make a name for herself (if she can) using it. I am better off being just another user and being able to put my efforts elsewhere. ## Well, most pages run on HTML, so it's not really a choice you have. If you want the page to load, you must send the html to the browser. Anyone can then look at it.Any really clever stuff, like Google's search algorithm or Facebook's story selector runs on the back end, so is not visible.

What school of thought are they applying here?","I’m not sure about current day, I’m guessing that both are equal and after looking at the other answers, it looks like my guess was correct. But historically there was a difference. Both in how the algorithm behaved and in the speed. Depending on the data type and target implementation platform this might actually be important.If I remember correctly [ mind you, I hadn’t looked into this for over a few years ]:while( i=0, ++i, i<Number) was different from while( i=0, i++, i<Number) in one significant aspect:In the first case the iterator goes up right as you enter the loopin the second case the iterator goes up as you are leaving the loopTherefore if you wanted to work with the iterator in the loop for any reasons, this might be the cause to look into. In theory we could be talking about performance but I’m not so sure about that:If we’re talking about your generic PC or other devices with CPU speeds in GHz , cache in MBs and RAM in GBs… then unless you’re doing some crazy thing like thousands of nested loops, the difference is nonexistent to insignificant.If we’re talking about specialized embedded systems, this might actually be important, depending on the system in question. ## A post increment value typically requires more overhead as the value of “i” must be preserved and requires a “copy” to be made. Consider that the inherent underlying code will translate to a single assembly language instruction: inc CX, where the value of “i” is stored in register CX. I typically use CX as a counter.To deploy a post i++, requires additional code to manage the value of “i” by pushing an “incremented” copy onto the stack and popping the copy back to the original counter register (CX): mov ax, cx / inc ax / push ax / ….. EXECUTE Loop ….. / pop cx.There was a day when code execution time was critical and “tight”, high speed code was the very essence of assembly language. I recall referring to charts showing “cycle” times of various assembly instructions to ensure the most efficient and effective procedures were implemented. Cycle times mattered on 4.7 MHz PC’s as did memory management.Today’s faster processors make seemingly miniscule optimizations less concerning and I would even suggest “sloppy” programming. A person who wins the lottery is likely to manage their new found money much differently and with less regard than the person who “sweat it out” through the hard times to earn the equivalent value. 4.7 MHz and 64K of memory is liking coding to a tight budget compared to wealthy 2.7 GHz and 16GB of memory or more environments we now have the pleasure of working in. ## The reason is “generic programming”.The ++ operator can be an override serving whatever class, not necessarily an integer or a pointer.In the most common case it is an “iterator” (a generalized pointer referring an element into a container) whose “move forward” action and its “copy” action can be quite complex:class complicated_iterator{	a_very_big_state_1Megabyte_long here;public:	bool operator==(const complicated_iterator& s) const 	{ return are_same(here, s.here); }	bool operator!=(const complicated_iterator& s) const 	{ !(*this == s); }		auto& operator*() { return get_element_from(here); }	auto& operator++() { move_to_next_of(here); return *this; }	auto operator++(int)	{ 		auto z = *this; // CRAP! this will copy 1Megabyte!		++*this; //oh dear ... just the same as ++ !		return z; //no copy, NRVO will optimize this.	}}Now, imagine what happens when you dofor(auto x = my_complicated_cointainer.begin(); 	x != my_complicated_coontaner.end();	x++) // CRAP! 1Megabyte copy every time!{ glorify(*x); }respect tofor(auto x = complicated_cointainer.begin(); 	complicated_coontaner.end();	++x) // Already done?{ glorify(*x); }A good compiler can recognize the “problem” and change x++ in ++x intself, proven that x++ call ++x and does just a copy but … why don’t just keep it simple?Note:Of course you can dofor(auto& d: my_complicated_container) glorify(d);but … what do you think it calls, to go from one d to the next one? ## In C++, the pre-increment operator for a user-defined type is usually of the form:MyType& MyType::operator++() {  // increment state  return *this;}while the post-increment operation is:MyType MyType::operator++(int) {  MyType copy { *this };  operator++();  return copy;}Even with return value copy elision there is still a copy step. Since in C++ the type of an iterator can be anything, and the increment is usually performed in a void context, habitually preferring the pre-increment operator is a good practice. Compilers have gotten better about dead-code elimination, but it cannot eliminate the copy because it may have hidden side-effects. ## Assuming this is C or C++, unless you are not optimising, have a poor compiler, or are actually reusing the variable in the same expression, there is no performance difference. Easy fast legibility is king. Choose one and stick with it:. So each time you use the other version, there must be a reason for it. ## Like what some of the Quora readers have already pointed out, many modern compilers are highly optimized and will probably generate the same codes whether you use ++i or i++.The followings are compiled via Delphi C++ Builder (originally developed by Borland but now owned by Embarcadero Technologies):As one can see in the first case, the assembly codes generated are actually identical.In the second case when we assign i to j - before and after incrementing i - the only difference is when to increment i (i.e., content of [ebp-$0c]), mirroring the intent of the c++ code. So, in terms of machine execution at the assembly level for the 2 codes, they are the same.Borland is a pioneer in developing fast and highly optimizing PC-based compilers in the 80s. Microsoft was behind Borland in compiler technologies in those days.In the late 90s, Microsoft started to hire away dozens of top Borland's developers by offering large signing bonuses of several millions of dollars and other incentives. Microsoft even sent limos to Borland HQ to take Borland staff out to lunch in its bid to hire them. Borland then sued Microsoft for hiring away its key staff so as to put it out of business.""It's like we're in the desert, and Microsoft is stealing our water bottle,"" said Borland.Borland sues Microsoft over brain drain ## First of all i would like to appreciate you for this practice of comparing your solutions with the other top coders answers for furthur optimisations.This makes you a quality programmer.Now coming to your question ,i++ could potentially be slower than ++i, since the old value of i might need to be saved for later use, but in practice all modern compilers will optimize this away.We can demonstrate this by looking at the code for this function, both with ++i and i++.$ cat i++.cextern void g(int i);void f(){    int i;     for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)        g(i); }The files are the same, except for ++i and i++:$ diff i++.c ++i.c6c6<     for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)--->     for (i = 0; i < 100; ++i)We'll compile them, and also get the generated assembler:$ gcc -c i++.c ++i.c$ gcc -S i++.c ++i.cAnd we can see that both the generated object and assembler files are the same.$ md5 i++.s ++i.sMD5 (i++.s) = 90f620dda862cd0205cd5db1f2c8c06eMD5 (++i.s) = 90f620dda862cd0205cd5db1f2c8c06e $ md5 *.oMD5 (++i.o) = dd3ef1408d3a9e4287facccec53f7d22MD5 (i++.o) = dd3ef1408d3a9e4287facccec53f7d22 ## for(..;..;i++) has no advantage over for(..;..;++i) but reverse may not be always true for atleast 2 cases:1. If type of i is changed from int to some class2. On some legacy compilers. ## ++i is comparatively faster than i++. i++:Create a temporary copy of i.increment i.return the temporary copy ++i:increment ireturn i.But this difference is in terms of nano-seconds and any modern day compiler should be able to optimize this. I am assuming that 'i' is of primitive type. However if 'i' is non-primitive type then the difference is non-negligible. ## As other answers have pointed out, ++i is slightly faster.However, it's worth noting that in algorithmic competitions such as TopCoder, small optimizations like this one are mostly irrelevant. Problems (and their time limits) are designed so that if your algorithm is fast enough, you'd pass with or without this, and if it's not, there's no way your solution is passing. ## I had the same question sometime ago. I think it is largely due to the good habit.In general, for iterators, the prefixed increment, “++itr” , returns a reference to the iterator; and the suffixed increment, “itr++”, returns a copy of the current iterator. Therefore, “itr++” is slower than “++itr”. But this difference in prime type is negligible I think. At least, an easy optimization can be done by compiler.It is a good to know the difference and a good habit to keep. If you want to know the details, you can google “how to implement a c++ iterator”.

If you have code that's too large, arrange it between smaller functions. A good criterion there is that they have to be small enough to be independently testable.The purpose of a classes (in C++) is to implement invariants. That's what constructors establish, public member functions assume as preconditions and gaurantee as postconditions. For example, if you want to implement a vector, you don't just create an array of three pointers (start, size, capacity) and have push_back/resize/erase take that as an argument. You create a class whose constructor and every member function ensure that size is less than capacity, that if capacity is greater than zero, starts points at allocated storage of that size, and that if size is greater than zero, there are objects in that storage. Because vector is a class, there is no way to invalidate that assumption, so vector's member functions never need to test for it (and some preconditions, such as ""is the begin pointer pointing at allocated storage"" are untestable anyway, so must use classes to guarantee) ## The way I think of it, functions have a set of preconditions. If the preconditions are satisfied, the function will always effect a postcondition.For example, sqrt always works given that the argument is nonnegative. However, float and double allow negatives and nans.What I want is to create a class that wraps the concept ""Nonnegative number."" The constructor ensures that the vale is not less than zero, and additionally, no operation on that class can make the number negative. This maintains an invariantNow, I create an overload of sqrt that takes this class. Now I know I'll never have invalid input.I use this technique to also ensure I don't mixup arguments to functions, e.g.Int doTrade(float,float,int,char)VsVoid doTrade(Price,Side,Quantity)The second version won't compile if the arguments are mixed up.So I tend to have many many small classes, each protecting a small invariant. ## I think more appropriate question would be how the design for the project should be and classes be created , interacting another classes/interfaces etc as per the requirement.I hope you will get the answer. May be time to look into OOAD/ design pattern sections too may help you a bit. On other note , Technically how small can a class be : it can be empty class and its still fine. C++ compiler will compile and run the code fine. ## A class that's used to implement Resource Acquisition Is Initialization and whose job is to hold a handle to some other resource and release it on destruction might be very small, but couldn't naturally be folded into some other class.  That's a very common idiom.  It might well need no more than a short constructor, a short destructor and a private data member.  In that case, though, we're using the class more for instance-management than for code-reuse.  (Some languages that support classes also support interfaces or roles for code-reuse divorced from instance-management, but C++ doesn't have those, and uses classes for both purposes.)Personally, I don't have a problem with small classes.  There's still a place for a C struct with no methods at all. ## Generally a good rule of thumb is to think about if your function is related to the functionality of your bigger class. For example if you have a class that is all about managing menu items and you need a function to trim a string, these two functionalities are completely unrelated so it makes more sense to move the trim function to a new class or add it to a more generic Helper class as a static method.This concept is generally referred to as Cohesion."

A value of narrower data type can be converted to a value of a broader data type without loss of information such as int to double. This is called widening conversion."
"/Should-anonymous-code-blocks-be-used"," Coding Style,  Functional Programming,  Java (programming language),  Computer Programming","Should anonymous code blocks be used?","A better name for this is a nested block, rather than an anonymous block since most blocks are not named - they are children of another syntactic construct such as an if statement.You shouldn’t use a nested block unless you have a good reason to, and there isn’t a better alternative. However, this is not the same as recommending that nested blocks should never be used - they can sometimes be useful for limiting the scope of variables in the body of a complicated method.If you are following good practice of keeping method lengths short, then nested blocks probably aren’t necessary. If your method lengths are starting to get long or complicated, then it is good idea to consider refactoring the body of the method into a number of smaller methods. If you do this, the need for nested blocks in the original (now refactored method) will be reduced.Only if you have a reason to have a really long method - it might be a unit test, for example - then there might be a reason to use nested blocks to limit the scope of variables used for a particular fragment of the unit test to that fragment. ## If you meant anonymous function like lambda, yes it should be used as the code is more readable for a function with a couple of lines.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/..."

It had been written by Ken Thompson when he was a member of the Multics project. Like most code for Multics, it was written in PL/I, a language that supports long identifiers, several looping constructs, multiple data types, and, in the right hands, can enable a programmer to write readable, efficient, high-level code. Ken’s code looked something like this:if p->a.b(i)=q->c.d(j) then goto x;In other words, single-letter identifiers, goto statements instead of looping constructs, both backwards and forwards gotos, and no comments. Very dense code. No indentation or excess white space.He was writing PL/I code as if he was still coding in assembly language. It was unreadable and unmaintainable. Oh, and Multics crashed periodically because his data structures got messed up. The exact message was “ttyfree: error 3”. I was reading the code to try to find the cause of the crashes. I had to give up. The project assigned someone else to start over.A few years later, as we were starting Stratus Computer, we looked at using Unix instead of writing our own operating system. We had to reject Unix, not because the code was bad (it was) but because the Unix of 1980 was a toy that didn’t support the features in use by commercial customers of the day. It didn’t support Cobol. Access control was weak. It didn’t support multiprocessing. It had one lock to protect kernel data structures. Its file system was weak and it crashed a lot. We elected to write a new operating system, which we named VOS. Thank goodness.That Unix survived its first few years is a tribute to the vision of Thompson, Ritchie, Kernighan, the Bell Labs environment, and innumerable university students who stayed with it, despite its many flaws. The concepts were good even if the initial execution was weak.Oh, and the linker that I wrote for VOS, while enhanced many times since, still contains almost all of the code that I wrote back in 1980–81. The hardware-specific portions of VOS and Unix got rewritten with every major new platform. The higher, more abstract, levels of the system, once mature and stable, tend to last a long time. So if you find some original source code for Unix, portions of the commands and utilities would be the code most likely to survive for many years. The kernel, not so much.Hope this sheds some light on the subject. ## Why have most of the original UNIX source code been purged or rewritten? Modern operating systems such as macOS and Windows still contain remnants of their roots such as NeXTSTEP and MS-DOS respectively.Better compilers, more extended standards, more address space, newer and more optimum algorithms.Though MS-DOS is part of the failure in security, Windows itself uses the NT kernel, and not MS-DOS; but still incorporates insecure design, and has refused to follow industry standards for security or modularity. Resulting in a very insecure product.And contrary to what Garry Taylor says, NT was designed by Dave Cutler - and it follows the design of previous kernels he designed - VMS, and earlier RSX, which go back to 1971.And they weren’t all that secure either. ## Ultimately things change, get improved, re-written etc. A driver for a 1980s Sun workstation framebuffer is completely different to a modern GPU. Disks are different, buses are different, CPUs are different. UNIX was simply made for a different kind of computer to what we have now.Windows is a bit different in that it’s not descended from MS DOS. Windows is a somewhat more modern design than UNIX and comes from the NT family, which is much newer than UNIX is.Windows is in fact considered to be more similar to OpenVMS, and doesn’t have any sort of similarity to MS DOS, or any MS DOS ancestry."

I’m sure they also have multi-level backups, distribuited across the planet, locked and secured in electronic vaults. A lot of their code is open-source and it can be simply downloaded from internet. Except for extinction event that would wipe humanity like dinosaurs and destroy the internet I cannot really imagine such a scenario. And, as you probably know, deleting a file does not wipe the data until the contents is overwritten. So just deleting the files would not “lose” the data, you would have to physically destroy the machines at the same time, or in some way fool thousands of people who happen to be best engineers on the planet at the same time so that they wouldn’t notice something is wrong. Oh wait, I haven’t even mentioned that they have security, monitoring, intrusion detection, fire and flood protection, redundancy and so on. Good luck with that.But let’s say that somehow this still happened and that Facebook as a company was still operational. They would probably start with data recovery as usual. This means looking for pieces that could be scraped from various sources and putting them together, filling the missing pieces. The real value here is not the data on computers but in the minds of engineers that know how things work. Those engineers can write the software again, probably even better than before. Most likely they would also use this opportunity to rewrite some legacy systems for which they didn’t have the time before.You didn’t say anything about production servers - I assume you mean they would still be at least partly operational, which is highly likely in any scenario where Earth isn’t completely obliterated. In that case, they could use production servers as a source of information for recovering the data. For scripted languages such as PHP, you usually have a full copy of code where it is running.For sure, it would set them back, but it’s perfectly doable. There might not be updates for a while, and the value of their stocks would drop. But as long as they had the money to continue the business, they would be back in no time. End users would probably not even notice anything."

It was on an IBM mainframe. I loved working with it. It had a basic cycle data gathering and transformation cycle, hooks to the OS, databases, SQL, file operations, reporting and visualizations, functionality suited to large data center operations like backup and archiving etc. However, it was leased on an annual licence and was expensive. But all IBM MF centers had large budgets and the ROI justified the expenses. They had good training programs and workshops, which were also expensive. Basically a corporate fit.R, which started life in 1993, was a statistics and personal programming tool. However, it has grown and matured extremely well. It has a ton of libraries and a rich set of idioms. Free training and outreach is available all over the web, with open courses coupled with statistics and data science. Data cleaning, piping to other services, shaping, graphs and charts, all available. Machine learning and neural network libraries also exist. All free to use.I don’t think the learning curve is different to any other programming language. Interchangeability with other languages like Python and Java is available. If corporate hand-holding is needed, you can hire consultants to do that.SAS also has all these features, but is a commercial (and expensive) product. SAS is available on all platforms like Unix, Windows etc. They do have attractive discounts for students and academics at schools/universities, but they are proprietary and not free.As I am out of the corporate world, I have not used R in such settings. So currently R is my language of choice, along with Octave (a free version of Matlab) and Python.Be that as it may, programming languages per se are not like life-long marriages. Its more like dating and living together. After a while, you can switch to the other languages, and skills acquired can be transferred to work with it, though there will be a “syntactic” learning curve."

Interesting question!I could probably give a better answer, but I am work so gotta get off my phone :D ## Im about to suggest you Learning FORTRAN . Im think that very language contains all this style inner core. ## I learnt mathematics and taught myself to program. In general, if you have training in mathematics, two things might happen to your program.First, you are not afraid of using very complicated logic, especially ones with numerical routines. At least some of my mathematical friends as well as me cannot stand an algorithm that is not analytically optimized, therefore it is likely that we will spend a lot of time on it. Unfortunately, this also leads sometimes to very unreadable codes.Second, most mathematicians, are actually not very good at programming, including me. The problem lies partly a lack of formal training in writing programs. On the other hand, another problem is if you like mathematics, you are only going to enjoy only part of the programming processes. In math, if you know how to solve a problem, you are basically done. In programming, if you know how to solve a problem, well, you can get started now. Therefore I know many people who really hates to keep the program tidy and is quite impatient, including me. ## they tend to be more rigorous and introduce more solid proofs .most of them write recursive solutions more often even those who just started programming and they probably know some magical formal that solve the problem in constant time .but if you ask about the language feature and how they i didn’t notice any differance"
"/What-would-happen-if-someone-hacked-Facebook-or-Google-and-deleted-their-source-code"," Source Code,  Computer Hacking (security),  Google (company),  Facebook (product)","What would happen if someone hacked Facebook or Google and deleted their source code?","Let’s assume someone obtained access to my machine, together with my production access credentials, and used those to submit a change to the repository that deletes all the code.Note: this assumes I have the permissions to delete all the code. I don’t, and I’m not sure anybody does - let’s, however, assume that they also found some exploit that allows them to ignore these permissions.A few seconds later someone tries to sync to the head of the repository.“Shit, the code I wanted is gone? Wait, let’s look at history, who deleted it? Some guy named Onufry? Who is that guy even? Anyway, doesn’t matter. Let’s roll back the change, notify security, and get back to work.”Result: Minor inconvenience for people for something like ten minutes, tops. Plus, possibly (depending on how that happened), I might be in trouble.Note - the author of the question maybe assumed that the code is deleted in some permanent fashion.I think we (Google) might actually not even know how to delete all the copies of the code; including history - I think that even if the folks who work on the repository of Google’s code decided to consciously delete all the code, it would probably be a multi-step procedure, and would require design and preparation; plus possibly physical access to some storages of write-once data which does not have an API for deletion. It’s unlikely you could actually do it, and if you were able to compromise Google’s security to the level needed to do it, you’d probably have ways to hurt Google much more than by deleting the source code. ## They would be caught if not before pressing the delete key, pretty soon after. They likely wouldn’t even get as far as having access to the source code.Google/Facebook cancels the delete and the service carries on uninterrupted, or at least pretty close to it.If, by some miracle, someone were able to get access to the source code for Google or Facebook then they would be doing incredibly well. Let’s say for the sake of argument that they did manage to delete the entire (presumably massive) collection of code from every server that contains it (newsflash: Google particularly is stored on servers across the world to provide the fastest search results possible), the affected company will just chuck you off the system, send the police or men in suits to arrest you, then restore the service from their latest backup (presumably taken at the very least daily). Realistically you’re not going to do very much by deleting the source code for any website or webapp - especially with services as big as Google and Facebook.So the short answer to your question? The hacker gets arrested (pretty much guaranteed) and the service continues with either virtually no interruption, or no interruption at all."

"/Does-commenting-out-a-chunk-of-code-that-you-dont-need-make-the-whole-code-slower"," Code Comments,  Software Engineering,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Does commenting out a chunk of code that you don't need make the whole code slower?","Overall, I’d have to say that no, they don’t make code slower, especially if you’re commenting out (I assume bad) code.There is a slightly subtlety to it though, and that’s with compiled languages, comments are just simply lost, they are in no way evaluated or even known by the time you get to execution. Intepreted languages are slightly different, there the comments will be part of the execution. Whether it’s in JavaScript where you’ve commented out part of code or large parts of comments in a Python script. In the former case, you’ll have to transfer these bytes over the network and that will cause you code overall to slow down, if ever so slightly. In the case of the latter, it’ll make the tiniest change because it’ll be data that’s read. Whether it skips it or not, there will be some processing to it. In the case of Python, the impact will likely be negligible. ## In compiled languages comments don’t even exist in the resultant executable. In most interpreted languages comments are pulled out before the code begins parsing meaning that comments aren’t even present in the code as it is interpreted.Comments alone have virtually zero overhead, with no impact on execution speed. Commenting code out can change the control flow altogether however, and this can mean absolutely anything with respect to correctness and execution speed. For example this code might infinitely loop only because the line commented out should not be commented out:void func() {    int x = foo(0);    while (bar(x)) {        //x = foo(x);    }}Incidentally, it’s also possible that uncommenting the line takes a terminating loop and makes it an infinite loop. In this case it all comes down to the implementations of foo(…) & bar(…) ## No it does not. When you compile the source code with huge chunk of comments in it, the preprocessor replaces it with a whitespace.So the compiler does not see the comments at all as the preprocessor has removed them and it is not a part of the binary generated. Therefore size of comment blocks do not factor in the execution speed. ## It shouldn't. As a matter of fact, I would expect the code to run faster, depending on what the removed code was doing.Removing code lines means less code is converted to machine instructions, which means less (or at least similar) compilation and run times. It would be very interesting to see the case where removing code resulted in slower code. ## Of course not. In compiled languages, comments don’t affect the code execution in any way. In interpreted languages, the parser must parse the code anyway and as comments parsing is generally much faster than code parsing, I can’t imagine that commenting something out would affect the execution speed negatively. ## Comments are, by their very definition, meaningless to the program. In a server-side compiled language, code that is commented is as-if it does not exist. In languages where the code is transmitted and interpreted, the extra bytes associated with the comment can contribute to the transfer and parsing time; however, this should not be a real concern if you are following good engineering best practices; for example, when developing client-side JavaScript, you should be passing the JavaScript through an optimizer and minifier before deploying it that will strip the extraneous comments so as to not transmit meaningless bytes. ## Not by itself. Comments are ignored by the compiler.But, if you comment out the wrong thing, it could:int elem_idx = -1;  // -1 means ""not found"" for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {    if (a[i] == element) {        elem_idx = i;                /* break; */    }}Commenting out the break statement didn’t necessarily change the output of this program, but it did slow it down.It’s not the comment itself that slowed it down; rather, the slowdown arises due to the role the now-commented-out code played in the function. ## Every compiler I know, simply put, completely deletes comments. This is generally done in preprocessing phase. If there is no preprocessing it should be the job of lexer to ignore comments before feeding tokenized source code into parser or code generator, depending on the language. ## If it is interpreted language the answer is “very unlikely” or, in the worse case, “not practicaly noticeable.”If the code is compiled to the machine language, it is more interesting. Any modifications of the code (unless you remove the code already ignored by compiler as unused) may affect performance of different parts of application. Some parts become slower, some faster, others are not affected.This is related to code alignment / cache usage. In most cases it does not much matter since the performance impact is much less than other performance related factors. It may be noticeable for a specific part of the application, but not for the whole code. ## Not if the code is pre-compiled. It will have zero effect. Interpreted code could be affected if there are a lot of lines because the number of lines sent affects the parser but we’re talking microseconds. ## Probably depends on the language. If that commented code in any way is represented in the “output” format, then it might have effects.But the real point is: no matter what, commented out code will make it harder to read the rest of that source code.That is what you should worry about much more.Most likely, there are no runtime performance hits. But reading time will always be impacted.You only keep that code in your code base that you need. Stuff that is no longer needed, goes away (and is still available from your source code management system)! ## No, but you should delete code that you don't need.If you need it in the future, you can restore it from source control. ## I can't see any reason why it should — quite the reverse, in fact. Commenting makes that section invisible, and if that bit of code really wasn't doing anything then the program should run slightly faster without it. But if it's really unnecessary, why was it there in the first place?If you have commented it out, and the program is now running more slowly, then just possibly it was needed after all. Maybe you should try removing the Comment marking to find out! ## It makes the code a little bit slower (a few milliseconds). It would run faster when the compiler doesn't see the comment syntax.You can test in on an IDE that shows execution time like CodeBlocks.Comments make the code slower but the time difference is negligible. ## I’m going to put on my pedant hat, and say ‘maybe’, depends on the language.Anything interpreted language (from source code) will be slower, it’s more data, and thus take longer to read, it’ll only be slower on startup though.For compiled languages, it’ll be stripped out at compilation time, so won’t make any difference. ## No.Your computer ignore comments while running the code therefore commenting out a line is equivalent to deleting it.For instance, following two programs are one and the same for your computer.function add(a,b,c,d):	%temp1 = a+b    %temp2 = temp1+c    %temp3 = temp2+d    temp3 = a+b+c+d	return temp3andfunction add(a,b,c,d):    temp3 = a+b+c+d	return temp3 ## No. The final executable will be unaffected.However, it’s poor style to leave commented-out bits of code hanging around—if you don’t want it, delete it.Should it later turn out that you actually needed it, thankfully you have source control set up (right?), and can recover it from there. ## Does commenting out a junk of code that you don't need make the whole code slower?No, comments are optimized out of the code by the compiler. You however should not leave junks of commented code lying around if you don’t need it anymore because that makes the code unreadable. ## A2A: I was surprised to see a bunch of answers that say, in effect, “No, because the compiler will ignore them.”Don’t forget interpreted languages such as Python (or bash)!And JavaScript is a bit tricky in terms of whether it’s interpreted or compiled (as with most things, the answer is “it depends”).So yes, if you want to split hairs (and I often do when I teach), commented out code can have an effect on performance. Will you notice it? No. ## I only use commenting out to suspend lines of code. Writing long winded explanations seems a waste of time to me. Code is a self explanatory language and more meaningful that English in the given context. But commenting out is useful for “what if?scenarios”. ## You are not supposed to do that you should I’m fact delete the code junk. We already have good version control tools available if you need retrieve something lost. ## No, Most of the compilers ignores comments. Hence commented codes will never make your code slower ## nope. When you comment codes, they are ignored by the compiler and skipped. if your code became slower after commenting something, check your code again."

"/Which-is-faster-C-or-Python-3"," C++ (programming language),  Python (programming language),  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Which is faster, C++ or Python?","To solve this problem is to use the process called “Benchamarking.”That is take a program and implement it in both langauges. Then run the program and measure which one is faster.You can use a program that you typically run, and implement the program in C++ and Python and measure the performance.Another ways is to use a synthetic benchmark. That is a program is manufactured to stress the kind of computations are needed for a specific class of programs. There are several out there.Whetstone. This measure the typical mix of numerical programs.Dhrystone. Simulates a character and string processing program.Linpack. This does solution of linear equations. This is the benchmark of Supercomputer.None of these program are very long.I would suggest you measure the performance of these programs and post the results. ## Many ask this question as if it makes any difference which it does not. In fact there is no eye noticeable difference between Python versions 3.7 to 3.8 versus same program instances in C++. In fact I have been programming for 44 years and most of that time in C and later C++ and I will assure you if I had known how effective Python was back then before I retired then I would have used Python more.I have Python 3.7 and I run QT-5, Wx, GTK, FTLK, Win32 and Android Kivy and added all of these Libraries written in C++ in less than 2 minutes each using Pythons pip installer. Now in C++ if you can do this that easily without any problems then good for you.But honestly speaking I can also direct my CodeBlocks C++ and use those same already compiled GUI C++ Libraries in Python directly with my own C++ easier than I could install-compile-makefile-curse-and-swear to do them all using C++ by itself. And code away. But Python still has a greater advantage over C++—and that is its data types are unmatched. ## Lets just look at the basics. Python is made in C++, so in a parallel universe where laws of physics, electronics and other laws don’t work, you could say some things in python are almost the same speed as C++, but we don’t live in such a world, and Python is slow, real slow.When you start a Python program, you first load Python, all of it. Then you load all libraries in your import statement, even if you don’t use them. Then your code gets compiled when you get to it, this is why you can leave a line like this in your codedkjdjdkjdkjdkjdkdjAnd your python app runs until it reaches this line.C++ just starts, it is machine language.C++ compiles to native computer language, python is interpreted, which means if you run the same code twice, it gets compiled twice, unlike C++ which is just compiled.Why are people even asking these questions? Python is one of the slowest programming languages in use today, people don’t pick Python because it is fast, they pick it because it is a lot more fun to write code in Python that C++, else why use Python at all?Can someone please point me in the direction of something where this is claimed? This is worse fallacy than flat earth. I keep getting these crazy questions. ## c++ ## In my tests, Python was 30 times slower than C, and C and C++ run at nearly the same speed. ## python"

To his credit, the coding standard was then changed to something less daft. ## My very first assignment with my very first client for my very first employer in IT.I'm asked to look into some code because it behaves bad in certain conditions.I manage to find the cause in a relatively short time. Or so I think. I start to doubt my judgement of this stupid piece of code because right above it is one line of comment and it just sayd: “It is not as dumb as it looks”.So the obviously experienced developer who wrote this realised it looked stupid and warned others that it wasn't. He just forgot to tell us why.I was sure I was overlooking something, so I continued to search. It took me two workdays before I dared to nervously correct what I thought was the error in the first place. And guess what? It was as dumb as it looked.It taught me as early as possible in my career to not blindly believe comments or people more experienced than me. ## A former boss decided to enforce a 25% comment quota on the code. Looks like a good idea until you consider 1 out of 4 lines has to be a comment.so we had thousands of lines like://Catch error} catch(Exception ex){   //log the error message   Log.error(“something bad happen”, ex);}The worse thing about that is, we had to figure out what comment was a good one out of hundreds of unhelpful messages. So not only they where unhelpful they obscured the code horribly.Oh, I almost forgot to mention some details. Consecutive comments where considered just one line of comment; so a class header counted as one.Also, when people modified the code, most of the times they didn’t modify the comments, so you ended with things like://Add one year to the dateage = Utils.addDays(new Date(), 30); ## Almost all of them, because they restate the obvious.A comment should explain why the code does what it does or why it does it that way or why it doesn’t do it some other way.Almost any comment that explains what the code is doing becomes redundant once the code has been changed to be more readable. ## I think the most unhelpful was a multi line comments above a single system call (which itself was spread across a few lines of code) : to paraphrase the comment it was something like :According to the manual this call shouldn’t work. According to the support team this call shouldn’t work. According to the OS source code, it shouldn’t work. If you replace this call with the ‘correct’ one it will fail. If you remove or move this call, the code will crash.The biggest problem is that the comment never stated what the system call was intended to actually do, or what the correct call should have been. ## Funniest / most useless computer programming comments...I’m personally guilty of a few on the order of “don’t know why this works, but the correct/elegant way doesn’t”."

Programmers in modern startups often have access to much more sensitive information, such as company’s finances and plans for the next year. When your startup is still private and going strong, your competitors will kill to know your next move and how much money you have left to burn through.This interaction never happens directly, though. It’s unlawful and highly risky for a programmer to disclose sensitive information, and benefits are uncertain. So attackers will try to gently lure you into giving them information. This is most likely to happen to senior developers and architects.One common way is to setup a job interview with the programmer. You can taunt them with a very lucrative offer and then ask questions about their company. Another popular way is to meet the programmer at some conference and invite them to a nearest bar. It’s amazing how much shit people let out when they drink with you.Design details and decisions may also be valuable. But the actual code is worth much less than you think. It’s only one of the artifacts of the time and effort that went into development. Given complete loss of codebase, the same team of will recreate it in reasonable time, and likely better than before, because they already know what to do. Fire all your programmers and give new ones the code though, and you’re done.It’s also risky to use stolen code. There are many ways to get caught with it, and you don’t want to build your business on this time bomb. The more successful you are, the more likely you’re to get caught, and the more zeros you will have to write on the check. Architectural decisions are usually much harder to link back to whoever you stole them from. ## In my 35+ years of being a professional computer programmer, I can say that that has never happened to me. Perhaps I’ve just been unlucky.I’d be curious to know if anyone has actually experienced that."
"/Why-should-I-use-comments-in-my-code"," Code Comments,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Why should I use comments in my code?","A simple program only needs 1 or 2 functions or even none, so people tend to ignore the use of comments.However, programs and projects in real life are full of functions, variable’s names, numbers. Those make up thousands of codes in each partial package. Comments are the best thing to explain what a function does or what a variable means.Building a project, you barely finish it in one short moment. Imagine you start a project on Monday. On Wednesday that week, you’ll go back and look at multiple functions you did. It’ll take a long while to understand them. This is often really annoying. Instead, by having some explanation texts (comments), you’ll just need to scan through and be able to know what’s going on. It saves tons of time.What’s more, most of the big projects need a couple of people working on, not only you. Your comments would help your colleagues know what you are trying to do.My suggestion is learn to add comments ever since the day you started learning to program. It is a great practice. ## Let me tell you something before answering this question. Making the notes or memo of the things you have done before is a quite good behavior.which makes you well managed and helps to remember the previous works.Commenting while coding , making documentation of that code is not mandatory things while coding but doing so which may be useful in future for other purpose for collaboration to other bigger project or simply if you want to see sometimes you past works you may not understand you own work.So, its a good habit of commenting while coding . Its your completely personal choice .Happy Coding ## Yes you should use comments because they provide more detailed description of what the block of code is doing ,the comments you provide should be simple but meaning full and it should reflect what the code block is doing .It should be noted that sometimes good descriptive variable and method names are as good as comments,therefor it is much better to use good descriptive variable names along side with your comments , find the book clean code by Robert C. Martin aka Uncle bob for all the goodies about clean code writing and maintaining.Your code is the work of art , do it well and let your audience (the ones maintains it ) enjoy the work of your art and let them appreciate the clean code you write as they read on it and have them answer the question on what the code does by just reading the carefully chosen variable names and method names in your code.Note also your comments should avoid ambiguity by not reflecting the variable names and methods names in the given code block as this could provide misleading information to whoever is maintaining your code and lastly never forget to test your code or to use TDD approach as this will help you update comments and variable to reflect the updated code whenever the code is updated or modified . ## Comments are most integral part of code. Some one writes the code its not necessary he/she is going to take care of the software for always.Comments tells other developer what the snippet of code do. This way any developer can manage the code of any other developer.Secondly the developer who writes the code he can also recalls with comments for what reason code was written and what it expected to do.One liner is Manageability. A good programmer always writes the comments very precisely. ## Your code will be read by an interpretter or compiler resulting in machine language telling the computer what to do.Your comments will be read by a human, communicating your motiivations for why you are telling the computer to do what is in your code.Depending on your chosen computer language, naming and structural conventions, the task of explaining why you chose the code you produced may require minimal or extensive commenting.Generally, one can write the comments first, as in test-driven development, where you specify what you intend the code to do, write validation tests, and only then write the code.The code itself, if buggy, may do something other than intended, but without a clear understanding of intent, there is no definitive way of evaluating gaps; although heuristics may be applied.Hackers can reverse-engineer binary code to understand what the computer does. The programmer's source code rife with undocumented assumptions is the cause of software insecurity. Misplaced trust that uncommented code conveys the full semantics of a programmer's intent runs astray when what the code does is different than what was intended.#include  <stdio.h>#include  <string.h>#include  <stdlib.h> int main (int argc, char **argv){	char buf [100];	int x = 1 ; 	snprintf ( buf, sizeof buf, argv [1] ) ;	buf [ sizeof buf -1 ] = 0;	printf ( “Buffer size is: (%d) \nData input: %s \n” , strlen (buf) , buf ) ;	printf ( “X equals: %d/ in hex: %#x\nMemory address for x: (%p) \n” , x, x, &x) ;	return 0 ;}The above program is not buggy--it behaves as designed, and a heuristic check may note that user input may exploit supplied format strings[1] to alter memory. A lack of comments does not make clear that such behavior is by design.Footnotes[1] Format string attack ## In programming,comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program.They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand,and they are ignored by compilers and interpreters.If any other developer want to understand your code than he/she can understand it easily by reading your comments and can make changes in your code.May helpful for you….thanks ## We use code to make computer understandANDComments to make people understand about that code.As simple as thatIn all it improves the readability of our program.In some developer-tester case -Specifically in White Box Testing, testcases are made in regard to the internal structure and working of the program.So when the code is sent to the Tester for testing, the person has to first understand it.As it is known reading a program is more difficult that writing one.Therefore it is considered a good practice to comment out to save precious time of others. ## Because the written language is easier and faster to read than computer instructions, even high level onesBecause you’ll save your coworkers a lot of time reverse-engineering your workBecause you’ll save yourself a lot of time reverse-engineering your work when you come back to it after 6 months and you don’t remember anything about itYou should also write documentation for the features you build. Code comments are for the explaining the low level code and classes, doco is for explaining the high-level featureset and architecture. ## Have a look at this blog post:Why should I add comments to my code? ## That makes code readable and easy to maintain.Every developer has his own style of writing code, thus it is difficult for other to understand the code fast so writing comments helps to understand the code easy. ## To make ur code readable to ur team members ( if development process ) 2nd: to easily read out : scan ur code for the part u errored ## Comment lines in code make it more presentable, understandable to everyone, including the developer. It helps to understand the code anytime after a long gap. written after “//” or “*”. ## because people see it (including you)If you don’t leave comments, every developer should look your entire code and don’t know about history or why you wrote like that. They will blame you. even you (future’s you) ## Easy to refer during troubleshooting or for reference in future. If not, you have to trace back the codes to understand its algorithm."

This is far more common than most people will ever realize, so there really is no unexpected “secret ingredients” in Microsoft Windows.macOS Source CodeApple uses one operating system as its base, upon which all Apple operating systems are built up from, so they all share common functionalityApple’s user interface is custom for each product, i.e. macOS has one user interface, iPhones have a different interface, etc. The interface is not open source, there is nothing secret in it other than Apple is the master of creating a simple looking interface that actually requires massive skill to design and polishApple’s core operating system is called Darwin, you may freely download and examine Apple’s source code:Darwin Open Source - ReleasesXNU Kernel: apple/darwin-xnumacOSiOSiPadOSAudioOSwatchOStvOSBridgeOSGoole also uses these two operating systems:SEPOS (L4 based)VxWorks Is reportedly the firmware OS embedded in Apple Airport Extreme and possibly Time Capsule ## Microsoft doesn’t publish the source code for their operating systems, and employees are legally prohibited from sharing it. There’s been no security breach that has resulted in the complete source code of Windows being released. Mostly, Microsoft limits access to the source repositories and build farms to limit the number of people with access; they pay those people well and have them sign agreements that prevent them from copying it and divulging it.Apple actually publishes the source code for the core of their OS. It’s open source, and everyone is invited to take a look. They make no attempt whatsoever to prevent people from viewing it, or modifying copies of it. However, the Apple servers that have their working code and build for the OS don’t accept pushes from outside developers — so nobody outside of Apple can make a change. Further, much of the macOS product is not the core OS but rather in their application frameworks — and that’s under the same sort of lock-and-key as Microsoft’s OS products. ## If you really mean the “source code” - it does not leave the company except for the open source parts.If you mean the compiled binary - they mostly don’t prevent people from reverse engineering. Some code may run on special hardware components (secure enclave on Apple devices comes to mind) which will not allow it to leave the component.And about ‘modifying’ a running system (e.g. what viruses and trojans would do), this is strongly guarded against using different security measures. ## Because Microsoft and Apple haven't provided their Windows and MacOS source code then to viewing them, developer/hacker must reverse source code from binary files. But, they used C/C++ to programming and these languages very hard to reverse. Beside, these OS are very large then it make reversing all of source to be impossible.

"/Why-is-camel-casing-used-in-programming"," Coding Style,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Why is camel casing used in programming?","Most programming languages don’t allow spaces or tabs in the identifiers (function/method names, variable names, module names etc), but many times you want to use a multiple word name so that your names are as appropriate as possible.In order to use multiple words in an identifier but allow the words to stand out, there are two options :CamelCase : Thr first letter of each word is capitalisedsnake_case : All lower case with an underscore separating words.The global style guide for Python (PEP8) for instance recommends using CamelCase for classes and Exceptions, and snake_case for all other identifiers. ## CamelCase (also ""camel case"" or ""dromedary case"") is a naming convention in which the first letter of each word in a compound word is capitalized. Examples include the video game ""StarCraft,"" the band ""FireHouse,"" and the company ""MasterCard."" The term ""CamelCase"" itself incorporates the CamelCase naming convention. While CamelCase has many applications, in computing, it is most often used in programming languagesand website names.Most programming languages do not allow the use of spaces in the names of functions, variables, or other entities. Therefore, programmers often use CamelCase to define objects within the source code. For example, related variables within a C++ program might be might have the following ""lowerCamelCase"" names: employeeID, employeeFirstName, employeeLastName, and employeeAddress. The capital letters make the names of each variable more readable.While most programming languages do not require CamelCase, certain programming languages use CamelCase as a standard naming convention. For example, in Java, all classes should be named using UpperCamelCase, while methods and variables should have lowerCamelCase names. The most common alternative to CamelCase is to use underscores (_) to separate lowercase words.Since domain names cannot include spaces, many web-based companies use CamelCase in their brand names rather than separating the words. This provides better cohesion between the company name and the web address. Common examples include YouTube, LinkedIn, and WordPress. ## Readability.If I have to speak for Microsoft based languages, I generally follow their Framework Design Guidlines.For example, they suggest;PascalCasing for all identifiers except parameter names, like HtmlTag and IOStream.camelCasing used only for parameter names, like htmlTag and ioStream.DO NOT capitalize each word in so-called closed-form compound words.and the most important…DO NOT assume that all programming languages are case sensitive. They are not. Names cannot differ by case alone.If they created a guidlines for casing, probably they had a lof of experiences about how increase readability of their code. Usually it is the best practise to follow these rules no matter which progrmaming language you choose.By the way, if you want a printed version of that page, you can get if from Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries, 2nd EditionA2A, thanks Christopher Suldo ## Most programming languages don't allow whitespace in identifiers such as variable names, function names or class names. Often, developer's need to use compound names like “top tax rate”, and to preserve readability, while avoiding the use of white space, they've come up with tricks like top_tax_rate or TopTaxRate. Different languages and communities have advocated different conventions for doing so. None of these conventions are objectively better than others, so the important thing is to strictly follow the convention in place for your particular language, project, community or organisation. ## It’s just a nice way of making separate words stand out when used as one word, like:getdatabaseconnectionis less readable than with camel case:getDatabaseConnectionOr in the C#/C++ style aka UpperCamelCase:GetDatabaseConnectionIn some languages, the style might not be camelcase but with underscores called snake_case:get_database_connectionWhich I quite like but is really frowned upon in most languages like Java or C#. ## Because someone said that it would make a good standard at some point. Camel casing, pascal casing, Hungarian notation, whatever. This is not that big of a deal. Use something. Try to be consistent. Move on to fight other battles, like actually providing value to customers. ## BECAUSEITISALOTHARDERTOPICKOUTBITSOFANAMEWITHOUTCLUESWHERETHEBOUNDARIESARE.WithCamelCaseItIsALotEasierToPickOutFragmentsOfIdentifierNames.This matters when naming variables and functions: ENQUELOCKEDBUFFER vs EnqueLockedBuffer.Similarly reasons apply for snake_casing_of_identifer_names."

I call it “The Cerny Effect”.Under the direction of Dr. Jeff Donahoo, who leads ICPC technology development at Baylor, a gifted grad student from Czech Republic, Tomas Cerny, had been assigned the job of moving a working prototype developed by another gifted student to production.Jeff came by my office and told me that a Cold War was brewing in the ICPC lab due to an insult delivered via a source code comment. So we walked into the lab to talk to Tomas.Getting right to the point, Jeff asked, “Tomas, did you comment Joel’s code to say that it was retarded?” Tomas confessed, “Yes.” Jeff asked, “What possessed you to call it retarded?” Tomas replied, “Because it IS retarded!”I’m just watching, Tomas quizzical, Jeff steamed, and silence with a capital “S”. Tomas reaches down and opens his Czech to English dictionary and there it was. Definition: “under developed, retarded.”Yes, development was not complete. And, the comment was changed to “Under Construction”. And we all had a good laugh about Tomas’ passion for expanding his English.

Tomas is today a professor of CS at CTU Prague, a cornerstone of ICPC technology, and a great friend.Not only did he earn a graduate degree at Baylor, he found his wife, a musician and Olympic-level track athlete. That is another ICPC love story.ICPC - The iCPC International Collegiate Proramming Contest headquartered at Baylor. ## Not me, but one of my brothers when he was working for a well-known British bank. This was early days of online banking, so the bank decided to join in. They felt they didn’t really have the expertise to do this themselves, so they farmed the work out to an Indian outsourcing company. What they got back was a completely unusable mess.After having given careful thought to the matter, the bank saw the error of their ways and decided to not make that mistake again. So they farmed out the work to a South American outsourcing company. What they got back was a somewhat usable mess.The key word here is “somewhat”. Their Java devs poured over the code, trying to fix all of the bugs, but there was one little problem: all comments were in Spanish (this was long before the days of Google translate). This was certainly an obstacle, but the code was close enough to working that they soldiered on, stiff upper lip and all that. Until one bug proved inscrutable and was traced to a rather large class that no one could figure out and it had a comment at the top of the code that they hoped was a clue as to what was going on. But of course, it was in Spanish.They finally called another employee who spoke Spanish and tried to read the comment, but to no avail. They couldn’t pronounce it, so they read the comment of the offending code letter by letter.When they were done, the person at the other end had trouble stopping his laughter long enough to translate. The comment read: “And further into the darkness we go.” ## Went anonymous and redacted the comment to protect the (semi-) innocent. This was my funniest AND most useful source code comment - although at the time, it wasn’t funny, now it is. Time will do that to you…It was 1980, the first leap year that this healthcare software package ran in production. I was on call - armed with a blindingly-fast 300 baud modem and a thermal printer :=) - and began receiving phone calls from East coast clients that all of their babies’ ages were suddenly wrong, as of midnight. Tracked down the offending code, which was a date algorithm that calculated ages but did not account for the fact that February could sometimes have 29 days.Right above the code section (which had some very dense algorithms), was a comment that read:“Stole this code from xxxx - NO idea what it does. If you have a problem with it, his home phone number is xxx-xxx-xxxx. Please call and tell him what a #$%^ he is for not commenting his code.”I called the number (yes, it was his real number), woke him up, we worked out a patch and I spent the next 5 hours chasing the bug across the time zones before midnight hit each one.Needless to say, the next day, the original programmer commented the source code and we took his phone number out. Or so he thought… Paybacks suck. :=) ## Those of you who have worked with IBM's VSAM (both z/OS and z/VSE and their predecessors) know of its headdesk-inducing idiosyncrasies.I was in tech support and erstwhile development for a TP monitor product from a German software company, although the original TP monitor was developed in the USA. It had an interface to VSAM files, and of course there was a control block to manage all sorts of things related to file access. Someone had a bad day, apparently, because in the control block comment for the field which had the address of the general error routine, there was this gratuitous comment: ""VSAM FUCKED UP AGAIN, GO HERE"". The best part was that the control blocks were published in a technical manual, so for almost two decades, this comment was in the manuals sent to customers. In fact, this was reported by a customer one day who was perusing the book looking for a different control block.Not a comment: my one application job. We had an internal standards and routines document. Our system programmer was asked to document a delay routine supplied in a piece-of-crap 4GL product, and to demonstrate it, his first draft was something to the effect ofIF TIMEDIFF >=5  SAY ""THE SYSTEM IS FUCKED, PLEASE BEAR WITH US""  SLEEP(10)ENDIFHe never got around to writing the full doc, and suddenly the submission deadline was nigh. He sent the file to the doc person without looking at it. A week later, about a hundred copies of the document were distributed. And, there it was, his unedited draft. ## #if 6 * 7 != 42 || 6 * 9 == 42#echo ""Preprocessor Error""#endifWell, technically not a comment, right, but fun nevertheless. This is still part of a very fundamental class in Tubmud’s sources.—-In the 90s I took part in a seminar using the PEACE / PURE project (an operating system written in C++). That project tried an academic approach and a super-clean code base. If I remember correctly, each method of each class had its own file, so they quickly had dozens or hundreds of files for even the smallest subtopic. Every file had a full-blown header comment which described the contents precisely in proper English sentences in several lines, often in several paragraphs.But that’s not the weird thing yet.The weird thing is, we found out at some time that the comments were all written in justified paragraphs. Each line was exactly the same length which made everything look very tidy. But whoever wrote this, didn’t write their sentences and then use a variable amount of ASCII space characters to achieve this. No, they obviously had chosen their words in a way so that they could achieve this with exactly one space character between each word pair.We were stunned when we found out. And whatever we did in this project, we always stuck to this rule from that time on. After writing the code we entered a commenting phase where we rephrased our header comments again and again just to reach a justified paragraph without the need of multiple spaces. This often took more time than writing the actual code and the comment in proper English.I never have seen more pedantic code in my life. ## Some years ago during my college days, I was writing a new device driver for the operating system RDOS, on the Data General Nova 840 minicomputer. So, I had access to the source code for the entire operating system. I was looking through the IPL sequence for booting the operating system, and discovered that it contained a module named JEHOV (the assembler limited all names to 5 characters), which allocated and initialized all the internal structures for the operating system. The documentation header for the module contained a comment explaining the module:JEHOV - it creates the world-----------------------------------------------------------------------Edit:Actually, the above is the second best comment I've seen. The best comment I've ever encountered was in the HTML source code for a Problem Report from our problem reporting and tracking system.An online report was auto-generated from our problem tracking database for every Problem Report each evening, so that the latest and greatest of each Problem Report would always be available online for ready reference by the engineers. I would save the HTML file locally, and add my notes and markups into the HTML as I worked the problem. I preferred this to using a paper printout, or the online database app, because the browser window could readily be re-sized to make it narrow, where it would then fit right next to the window for the work that I was doing on my computer, on that problem, for ready reference. Browsers reflow the text of an HTML document whenever the window is resized, so no matter how narrow I made the window, I still had all the text visible.In the course of scanning through the HTML source, to find the appropriate place to insert my notes, I came across a comment which read,<!-- This comment for rent -->Weeks later, when I was down visiting the IT folks for help with a problem, I popped by the office of the systems programmer who maintained the problem tracking software.""I would like to rent a comment,"" I said to her. When she asked me what I was talking about, I described the comment that I had seen in the auto-generated HTML.""You're in luck,"" she said, ""I'm going to be updating the report generator next week. I can change that for you while I am in the neighborhood. Now there's the matter of rent: It's going to cost you.""I asked her what she would like.""How about a red Ferrari?"" she replied.""Sure thing."" I said.A couple of weeks later, when I opened work on a new Problem Report, I saw that the comment in the HTML file now read,<!-- This comment rented by Bob Gaebler -->I popped on by the programmer's office and presented her with a little red Ferrari Hot Wheels car in payment. From then on, every Problem Report generated by the system had, embedded somewhere deep within the HTML code, my comment -- where it would probably never be seen by anybody, except those goofy enough to read through the HTML source code of their Problem Report, or by the next IT systems programmer to maintain the report generator code. ## One time I was looking through the source code of some random student games I had found at DigiPen, when suddenly I see/* Do NOT delete this comment */Naturally, I had to see what would happen if I deleted the comment. I deleted it, and tried to recompile it. It didn't work. I put the comment back in and it compiled like a charm.The error was LNK1000, which straight up says, ""unknown error; consult documentation for technical support options"" in the linker error documentation.Why that comment was necessary will forever remain a mystery. ## Not comments in source, but possibly amusing from the distant past (predating any of the languages listed in the question!)Several hundred years ago (well probably about 1969!), I was developing statistical software on an ICL 1900 in Algol (Consult a book on mediaeval history if necessary). The development procedure was to prepare your source code on punch cards, using a mechanical hand punch (12 keys, for some reason in 4 rows of three, the top row numbered 10-11–12. the other 1 to 9 - from distant memory, pressing 10 and 1 together gave you an “A”, 10–3–8 was “;”). There was no facility to print the cards locally. You then sent the deck of cards in a box to the computer centre, and if you were lucky got a printout back the next morning.The compiler had a nice little feature - after it flagged 25 errors, there was an extra message:“You are having a bad day”After 50 errors:“You can do better than this”After 75:“Why don’t you give up and go home?”Unfortunately, it was quite easy to generate dozens of errors simply by punching, for example, a “C” instead of a “;” - the compiler wasn’t clever enough to realise that you hadn’t punched the third hole of the character cleanly, and it read everything that followed up to the next terminator as a single line of code.Of the same vintage was the compiler error message:“Impossible happened”which I think came from a compiler on the London Atlas! ## I used to work on a high performance distributed key/value store. It was a clever piece of software with a simple API. If you wanted to retrieve a number the command was: GETN (get, numeric). If you wanted to store a number the command was: PUTN (put, numeric). Other commands were MGETN (get multiple, numeric), MPUTN (put multiple, numeric), INCR (increment), MINCR (increment multiple) etc.All commands went through a “dispatcher” function which parsed the request, figured out which command was being used, and called the corresponding handler function. The handlers were more or less self-documenting, so there weren’t a lot of comments on them just:int Server::handle_getn(…) {…} int Server::handle_mgetn(…) {…}Then one day, someone asked me to review the following change: +   // In Soviet Russia, Putn handles you!    int Server::handle_putn(…) {    }It was immediately approved, merged, and deployed. As far as I know, it is still in the code base. ## The RT-11 sources had section heading comments from bits of literature.The idle loop had ""Did nothing in particularAnd did it very well.""  from Iolanthe (Gilbert & Sullivan)Also from G&S, the Mikado this time, ""Behold the Lord High Executioner A personage of noble rank and title""  Had something to do with cancelling timers.Above the bit of code that was basically: you can't get here, you're screwed. was a bit from Barthelme ""The death of god left the angels in a strange position""There were a bunch more, drawn from a wide range of sources.  Got people to at least scan the code, looking for more zingers...From a change log at a prior employer.  Normal was to add a comment with  date, who, and what,  as the last line of the file. Once, when a release was imminent, and we were getting a bit punchy, the following got left....;; In the Year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eighty five on;;March the tenth, brave Sir ... and lord ....  did dyketh the evil variable;; some-random-cell from the good dialog some-screen-definition, ;; God Save the King. ## I worked with someone four years ago who was a contractor and now a good friend.Occasionally in the code, I'll still come across one of his philosophical paragraphs about the state of the code base from several years before my time. Sometimes the missives are directed at himself, a future developer, or just someone who once worked on the code base.I don't have any handy, but they are usually something like:/* So you may wonder why we are extruding the flumbozzle here in lines 2 through 7. This was due to the design of Lisa Smith and Jeff Jones’ original DB, implemented in 2009 before they really knew SQL and when they were working very long hours under much duress. Instead of forcing them to rewrite the back end, I took pity on them, so I clean up the messy data here. It is probably obsolete by the time you are reading this, so you can perhaps safely delete. - NN 31–10–2011 */I asked Jeff who Lisa was (I didn't recognize the last name in the code) and it was someone who had since been married and had a new last name. Jeff recounted the other side of the story, and it comported withNN’s.And a bonus story.I once had to debug about 10,000 lines of C code clearly written by a programmer who knew only Fortran. Furthermore, all the variable names were clearly in French! There was not a single comment in the entire code base, save one. And that comment was written in….wait for it….German! ## It's right time to show you this. Usually, I put it before my code in competitive programming contest...Hope you enjoy it!#Edit 1I will try my best to translate it into English.The picture at the top is The Buddha. People in China often say that ""Buddha bless us"" like ""God bless"". And for our programmers, we say ""Buddha bless, keep bugs away from us forever"" instead. That is right the translation for the following sentence佛祖保佑 永无BUGThe left one animal at the bottom is a monkey.  The word ""Programmer"" is called ""程序员"" in Chinese, and the character ""员"" has the same pronunciation with ""猿"", in return, ""猿"" is same with ""monkey"" in English. The right one animal at the bottom is a lion. The word ""Engineer"" is called ""工程师"" in  Chinese, and ""师"" has same pronunciation with ""狮"" which is called ""lion"" in English.So, they are called Mythical Animals for our programmers. The monkey and the lion represent ""Programmer"" and ""Engineer"" respectively.神兽保佑，通通ACThe above sentence means ""Mythical Animals bless that all of my submission would be accepted"". If you are not a competitive contest programmer you may not familiar with word ""accepted"" which means that our code is told right for a certain problem.Last but not least, forgive me for my poor English....(sad/**                                    _ooOoo_                                   o8888888o                                   88"" .

Remember those? Full of video games, and a couple of pinball machines. This was in the late ’80s, video game arcades were a huge business.I’m trying to remember the name of the game… you had a rifle mounted on a gimbal. A stagecoach rode past, and you had to shoot people trying to rob or attack the stagecoach. Or you were in a bar and had to shoot the bad guys while not shooting anyone else. Or any number of US old west scenarios.It had a fault in the game that made shooting unreliable at some points in the game. A bonus round, I think?So the fix handed down from the manufacturer of the game involved touching a ground probe to a pin on a PROM (programmable read only memory), thereby burning out a section of it. Cheaper than sending us a new PROM, I guess.The district manager gave me the instructions over the phone, and said to hurry back around to the front of the game and watch what came up on the screen.It caused the game to reboot. Normally, it boots with the usual version information and logo. This time, a big stream of alphanumerics streamed up the monitor, a few cryptic messages appeared, then the screen when blank. And then at the speed of someone typing, it said:Greetings Professor Falken.Shall we play a game?Then it booted normally. It never again showed that bootup screen. The only thing that would have been more awesome is if it had also spoken those lines in the movie voice.So some programmer put that in the source code. I have no idea what the plan was. On the off chance that this fix would have to be applied? It showed up on screen for maybe 10 seconds, never to be seen again. Tapping that pin with ground would not do anything after the first time. The ultimate Easter egg.For those too young to remember, it is paraphrasing lines from the movie Wargames.Cheyenne! That was the name of the game. It had a light gun rifle mounted on it. ## best commented codes , though not my invention , but found this in my repository.Code 1/*** For the brave souls who get this far: You are the chosen ones,* the valiant knights of programming who toil away, without rest,* fixing our most awful code.

That would be on the first day at my first job. Four pages of assembly language, undocumented, except for this line:6301 // ZAP THE CLOCKThere seems to have been some custom clock hardware tacked onto this computer, with wiring to make it respond as device “30” (the middle two digits in the instruction), and function (1) (the bottom digit), apparently ZAPS the clock (probably resets, or stops it).This was all done with basic 7400-series chips, not an integrated timer, and about five miles of blue wire-wrap wire, all in tangles, so the hardware itself was inscrutable. We had to figure out the timer and other opcodes by guess and by golly.Some of the BEST that I have put in were to explain why were doing crazy things. For instance the very early serial port chips from National had SERIOUS bugs:/* Determine by heuristics if this is the 16550- ORIGINAL chip, it has a FIFO that really doesn’t work reliably…. */so we had to test for those.The -A chips were better, but still had issues:/*** Reset, wait, reset, wait the -A chip is sometimes recalcitrant in setting the ready bit **/Also the dang first-run x86 CPU’s had POPF instructions that misbehaved:/*** Seems that POPF has timing issues, sometimes it allows an interrupt after the POPF pops the status register! Fake the POPF with a push and IRET */ ## This isn't something I myself encountered, but read in a joke long ago. It might be true since it is quite probable.A software developer was given responsibility of a module, and proceeded to read the code. The code was well written with good comments all round. But (s)he noticed a few places where the logic appeared incomplete, and (s)he wanted to find out more, probably sensing that these areas might require closer attention. Curiously, there was a comment stating, “// bad me” accompanying each block of incomplete code. The engineer assumed the original programmer was being self-deprecating, calling themselves “bad”, as in “my bad”, or something like it.Eventually, the developer reached a point where they couldn't understand one particular code block, and had to contact the original developer for clarification. Luckily, they were able to reach him and got the necessary clarifications. Along with that, they also asked him what the comment meant. What the original developer said knocked their socks off: He said that it meant “fix later”, which in Hindi is “बाद मे"" (literally means “later” and is pronounced as “bād meñ”).This joke still gets a good guffaw out of new colleagues at work. ## I was working on my final year project with my friend, few of our friends knew about the project. The project was almost complete and we were going to go to the professor to get a final check and edit.One night before we partied, some more of our friends joined the party, the party was good. When they left in the morning, one of my friend said, “Project acha bnaya h, check kar liyo dikhane se pehle (Dude, your project is awesome, just check it before submission)”I was like, “Ok”I almost forget and went for the evaluation, so i was outside the Professor’s room, so I ran my program for last time, and dude, it didn’t worked like it should haveSo i checked the code and I found theseOk , it isn’t a comment but it changed my logic and comments were followed by thisAnd then this after few linesand thisat the end,So, yeah he changed functions and class names tooAnd lot more, and seriously, i spent hours changing it and finally i found a commentSo, yeah he just copied and changed everything in a copy.I was angry but i was actually laughing, that was great prank anywaysThanks for reading! ## A much older fellow at work was struggling with his programming work. At the company the application programming was still being coded in IBM mainframe assemby language (BAL Basic Assembly Language). Aside from the normal difficulty some have with being extremely good using BAL, after a few after-hour tutoring sessions I realized something was going on with this older fellow, either deterioration, or he got moved into this position because of seniority, or even pysche probs or he needed to keep this job until pension.One night we are going over his program and I come across some coding that I had never seen to that point or since. (I have worked on more than 1 million lines of BAL).In IBM assembler there are “test” instructions like COMPARE (compare 2 values) that set a condition code to tell what is the result of the “test”.So picture this:You compare 2 numbers and you do “branch” instructions to go to the appropriate next instructions.When you compare 2 nums, the result can be “a” is higher than “b”, “a” is lower than “b”, or “a” and “b” are equal.N'est-ce pas?Here is the code and (I am still laughing about this one since 1973) and the COMMENTS.C a,b …..test valuesBE same …..if sameBL lo ….if lowerBH hi ….if higherB err *in case condition code is broken* ## I recently stumbled upon some awesome comments in source codes .These comments were provided by developers all over the world. Take a look at it, it could definitely make your day.// sometimes I believe compiler ignores all my commentsException up = new Exception(“Something is really wrong.”);throw up; //ha ha//When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing//Now, God only knows// I dedicate all this code, all my work, to my wife, Darlene, who will// have to support me and our three children and the dog once it gets// released into the public.// drunk, fix later// Magic.

It takes a little background:1971, a team of 3 of us are developing a Job Cost accounting system for a power plant developer. The COBOL programs would run on a 360/95, IBM'S largest, running OS/MVT.A programmer named T__ with 2 years’ more experience, and decades’ more sarcasm, was the #2 on the project. His facilities response to all comments, kind or cruel, was an extended middle digit of whichever hand wasn't holding his coffee. He was truly the guy we loved to hate.It came to pass that T__ was to take 2 weeks’ vacation. In his absence, I was asked to shepherd his source code through the compile phase, so he could begin testing its logic once he returned. I had full control of his 2-box source deck, and his latest source code listing.In COBOL, there is a section, usually given short shrift, titled COMMENTS. It's a compiler directive, whose contents are output into the source listing, but ignored by the actual compilation process. Like the /* — */ pairing in C++, everything between COMMENT and END COMMENT was strictly for humans to digest.I took out a handy coding pad, and traced the image of my right hand, with middle finger extended. I then refined the drawing, putting * and × in squares to create vertical and horizontal lines. I also added enough blank lines, so that the drawing would arise entirely on the second page. It took about 1 hour of keypunching and 2 print tests, to have the layout precisely as I intended.Came the day of T__’s return from vacation. Of course, I had not kept the prank to myself, so that 20 or so staffers were in the vicinity of his cubicle when we began our review of my efforts at testing his program. I began by apologizing that I was not entirely successful in resolving all the compiler errors, but that a strange and new error type had cropped up at the beginning. He scowled, as if such incompetence were no more than he had expected. Scowling, he grabbed the source listing, looked at it, and TURNED THE PAGE.As the full page outline of an upturned finger stared him in the face, with half the floor looking on … he turned and gave the crowd the Finger.Priceless. ## Not found by me, but this has to be the best one I've ever seen:/* 	 At  this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about the  Adobe  PSD format. 	 PSD is not a good format. PSD is not even a bad  format.  Calling it such would be an 	 insult to other bad formats, such  as PCX  or JPEG. No, PSD is an abysmal format. Having 	 worked on this  code for  several weeks now, my hate for PSD has grown to a raging fire 	  that  burns with the fierce passion of a million suns.  	 If  there  are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do both, in   different 	 places. It will then make up three more ways no sane human   would think of, and do those 	 too. PSD makes inconsistency an art  form.  Why, for instance, did it suddenly decide 	 that these particular chunks should be aligned to four bytes, and that this alignement 	 should not be included in the size? Other chunks in other places are either   unaligned, 	 or aligned with the alignment included in the size. Here,   though, it is not included. 	 Either one of these three behaviours  would  be fine. A sane format would pick one. PSD, 	 of course, uses  all  three, and more.  	 Trying to get data out of a PSD file is  like  trying to find something in the attic of 	 your eccentric old  uncle who  died in a freak freshwater shark attack on his 58th 	  birthday. That  last detail may not be important for the purposes of the  simile, but 	  at this point I am spending a lot of time imagining  amusing fates for  the people 	 responsible for this Rube Goldberg of a  file format.  	 Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest  specs for the PSD file  format. To do this, 	 I had to apply to them for  permission to apply to  them to have them consider sending 	 me this  sacred tome. This would  have involved faxing them a copy of some  document or 	 other, probably  signed in blood. I can only imagine that  they make this process so 	  difficult because they are intensely  ashamed of having created this  abomination. I 	 was naturally not  gullible enough to go through with  this procedure, but if I had done 	  so, I would have printed out every  single page of the spec, and set  them all on fire. 	 Were it within my  power, I would gather every  single copy of those specs, and launch 	  them on a spaceship directly  into the sun.  	 PSD is not my favourite file format.*/ ## As a professional translator of computer programs, I do get to see stuff that most people don’t. But I’m going to go one up on this. My examples aren’t source code, but the actual UI from two Microsoft products.One happened when I was at Microsoft and was asked to do something technical on an Italian project. I protested that I don’t speak Italian, but they said it was just a matter of lining up English error messages with Italian error messages.And of course, there was one Italian phrase missing.So I put in the only Italian I know: Una birra, per favore. “A beer, please.” Look, it was only a placeholder anyway, the Italian was going to be back next week so he could fix it.Turned out he liked it, and kept it.Same Italian, different product: there’s an error message he can’t make heads or tails of, even after discussing it with the coders. Deadline looms. In desperation, he writes the Italian phrase meaning “If you don’t know what you’re doing, keep your dirty fingers off the keyboard”.That one should really be used more often. ## RET; blah blah blah GINGER!I received an email from a customer asking the meaning of the above comment. I was both amused and confused. Amused because I immediately recognized the comment as being a caption from a Gary Larson Farside cartoon. Confused as to why on earth a customer was asking me, (I was working in a technology research lab at the time and had zero customer contact), what it meant. However, trying to be helpful I had the customer send me more of the code, which didn’t help me, and then send the entire sub routine in which the comment occurred. And my state of amusement and confusion morphed into a feeling more akin to embarrassment, as I finally recognized the code as 8751 assembly language, and the name on the sub routine header was, mine.Several years earlier I had written several thousand lines of ASM51 for a product line while working the product design group. Okay if I say it was for Multibus II Interconnect Control you might have have some idea of how old I am. Anyhoo, when I originally wrote the code our product group required EVERY line of code have a “meaningful” comment. Late one night, in defiance of this seeming ludicrous requirement, instead of typing “RET; return to calling routing”, I wrote comment above, inspired by my weekly Farside fix. Out of respect for Gary I won’t post is work here, but at the time I thought his caption was apropos. And then I forgot all about it.Eventually the code was packaged into a application note and distributed by our marketing team. By the time I received the customer’s email I’d held several other positions inside and outside of the company, and we no longer developed or supported Multibus products. However I was able to track down the marking rep who packaged and distributed the application note and prompted referred the customer to his care. ## I was once responsible for a team who were implementing a workflow solution around a heavily customised system that expected much closer integration than the workflow was used to providing.To manage the integration, we developed a programme that sat on the desktop and fed data between the workflow and the system. It had one point of interaction with the user: at the end of each transaction it would pop up a radio button asking what the user wanted to do next (e.g. start a new case, switch to a new customer etc).The programme was coded by a guy who was a brilliant coder but utterly ungovernable. Refused to document or even comment his programmes.The final programme was a few thousand lines of C++ code, only one of which was a comment. It read:// THIS IS WHERE WE PUSH THE FUCKING BUTTON ## Not in the source code, but in a custom program that is in production system, I encountered not just a comment but a short story!In this program, there was a redundant line of code that checked whether a certain field was initial before carrying out the follow-on process. But, that field was never populated by SAP and hence the custom validation remained useless. So, this witty programmer wrote an obituary for the check before commenting it out.""Short Story of a Lonely Check : ""There once sat here a sad, lonely, unused little check against CREDIT_DEBIT. Some kind soul passing through even pointed out this sad, lonely check and that it would be forever doomed to a life of loneliness & sorrow, unless Prince SAP should rescue the day by finally populating CREDIT_DEBIT on /1BEA/CRMB_BDI. Alas, the year 2017 is upon us with no record in PF of the Prince's arrival. It is, therefore, with a heavy heart that I have decided to put this check out of its misery. ""if ls_item-credit_debit is initial. Right now this is useless because SAP doesn't bother populating this field at all.Also while debugging through a standard SAP code, I found the below comment to warn the users to never make any changes to that part of the code. “ALL HOPE ABANDON, YE WHO ENTER HERE”. ## About 40 years ago, I was working at a bank that did processing for a very large law firm in Houston. The program was entirely in Assembler and it was too large to fit in one piece in the available editor. Also, editing (in two pieces) had to be done on a typewriter terminal. All table lengths in the program had been hardcoded and all references had to be corrected every time the law firm added one too many new lawyers. I was attempting to fix the problems using named constants at the beginning of the program and was having trouble finding all the references that needed fixing. I would get dump after dump and for those of you too young to have seen a dump, it is a hex dump of RAM on one side of the page with the character interpretation on the right side of the page. Of course, most of the interpretation was trash except where a literal was put in by the programmer. Late one evening while I was pondering weak and weary through another messy dump, I followed a link to a page I hadn't been on before, and there at the address was the following: IF YOU ARE HERE YOU ARE LOST. I laughed so long and loud that the security guards showed up. ## Not one comment but a source module full of them. And maybe not “best” but definitely memorable. I was a grad student in Computer Science at Cornell in 1970 working as a research assistant on the PL/C compiler, a checkout compiler for PL/I written in IBM 360 assembly language. I was working on the lexical analyzer, the part that converted the text of the program being compiled into a string of tokens. I was optimizing it for performance. Among other things it did spelling correction for misspelled PL/I keywords. But the person that wrote it didn’t believe in changing comments once they were written. The spell checker/corrector had a TON of spelling errors in the comments. I thought that was pretty funny. Less funny, when the sense of a conditional branch had been changed, e.g. from Branch Equal to Branch Not Equal, the corresponding comment was NOT changed from e.g. Yes to No. Very confusing! ## I have two favorites; they are both by Bill Paul, who did a lot of work on FreeBSD, and is currently employed by Wind River Systems, which was recently acquired by Intel.  Bill is an extraordinary programmer, who does not suffer fools gladly, and has a wicked sense of humor.Here's the first one; it's from the RealTek 8129/8139 PCI NIC driver; I reformatted it a bit, since Quora does not support 72 character lines in code quotes:/* * The RealTek 8139 PCI NIC redefines the meaning of 'low end.' * This is probably the worst PCI ethernet controller ever made, * with the possible exception of the FEAST chip made by SMC. * The 8139 supports bus-master DMA, but it has a terrible * interface that nullifies any performance gains that * bus-master DMA usually offers. * * For transmission, the chip offers a series of four TX * descriptor registers. Each transmit frame must be in a * contiguous buffer, aligned on a longword (32-bit) boundary. * This means we almost always have to do mbuf copies in order * to transmit a frame, except in the unlikely case where a) * the packet fits into a single mbuf, and b) the packet is * 32-bit aligned within the mbuf's data area. The presence of * only four descriptor registers means that we can never have * more than four packets queued for transmission at any one * time. * * Reception is not much better. The driver has to allocate a * single large buffer area (up to 64K in size) into which the * chip will DMA received frames. Because we don't know where * within this region received packets will begin or end, we * have no choice but to copy data from the buffer area into * mbufs in order to pass the packets up to the higher * protocol levels. * * It's impossible given this rotten design to really achieve * decent performance at 100Mbps, unless you happen to have a * 400Mhz PII or some equally overmuscled CPU to drive it. * * On the bright side, the 8139 does have a built-in PHY, * although rather than using an MDIO serial interface like * most other NICs, the PHY registers are directly accessible * through the 8139's register space. The 8139 supports * autonegotiation, as well as a 64-bit multicast filter. * This is a thing of beauty to be sure!  Rumor has it that Bill has been offered all sorts of things to remove/revise/change/update/etc. this comment, and has refused.The second comment is a modified BSD license ""hold harmless"" clause, which Bill uses on his code.  It's not all that modified, and most people look at it, see the boiler-plate, and move on, never having read it in depth.  Here's the text, again reformatted for Quora: * THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY Bill Paul AND CONTRIBUTORS ``AS * IS'' AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT * NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY * AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.  IN NO * EVENT SHALL Bill Paul OR THE VOICES IN HIS HEAD BE LIABLE * FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR * CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, * PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, * DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED * AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT * LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) * ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF * ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.Did you miss it?  It's easy to miss.  Here is the interesting part, but with highlighting (again, Quora does not allow highlighting in code blocks, so, again, reformatted): * AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.  IN NO * EVENT SHALL Bill Paul OR THE VOICES IN HIS HEAD BE LIABLE * FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, ORPure, and utter Genius! ## I didn’t encounter it myself, but I overheard the conversation in which the perpetrator defended it. The conversation went something like this:“Yes, I know those are offensive words. I put them there because that code was never intended to go into production, and I knew that if I screwed up and it ended up in production, I’d end up getting a call like this one.”This was from that same guy who thought he could speak several languages, but from listening in on his many attempts to make himself understood on the inexplicable foreign calls he often made, could not.This was the same guy who got himself beat up on a regular basis at the local gay bar. I’m not judging, but dude, if you can’t take a punch, stop picking fights.This was the only employee of this firm I ever heard from who—a few months after this call—was escorted off the property.Pete, if you’re reading this, you’re a piece of work, but thanks for the abacus. ## One of the best I came across was on an internal system on my first job. The code was an work scheduler type process running on VMS; this was back in 1988.One of the first things that the code did was turn on a few allowed privileges (On VMS users could be granted privileges, and the administrator could set which privileges where on by default and which ones had to be applied for.There was an 9 line system call with the following comment above it :/** If you read the documentation - this call should not workIf you read the VMS source (in the grey filling cabinet near ***'s desk)this call should not workIf you contact Dec Support and ask them what should happen - they will tell you this call does not work.But - it does work - after many hours this works - do not touch it, do even reformat it **/The system call passed in a number of Null pointers to the system call which were strictly speaking mandatory - and no-one could understand why it worked correctly.Equally bizarrely if we reformatted the source code, so that some of the arguments were on the same line of code, it still compiled, but then crashed on that call.I think much later the issue was traced to a very obscure compiler bug. ## I'm currently maintaining someone else's code who left my company last year, which was shortly after I had joined. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. The first time I noticed a strange comment was here:Snippet// If a mismatch is detected attempt to repair the damage before reporting an error// This ought to be interestingI quickly lost confidence in the integrity of this code after reading that. Sure enough I proceeded to find more and more comments (and code) which made me *facepalm*.But here is what I think is the best comment in the code:Snippet//private void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)//{	//System.GC.Collect();//}Why is this the best comment? Because I'm the one who commented it out. I couldn't get myself to straight-up delete it because I wanted there to be some evidence that it existed in the first place. In production code for a professional software company valued at nearly $1B, there was garbage collection being explicitly invoked in a timer which ticked every second.Is anybody hiring? ## This happened yesterday (4:30 PM IST more or less) . I was watching some video on YouTube and it suddenly on the video player “something went wrong” message appeared. Wasn’t something new, then refreshed the page and this came. [500 Internal Server Error]I understood that it’s some sort of cryptic message for those monkeys. From yesterday, I’m trying to solve this cryptic message but I’m unable to. I figured that it won’t be too long that YouTube will solve the problem so I saved the whole webpage to my desktop for future reference. And I was correct they did solve the God know what problem in nearly 3 to 5 minutes.Oh! yeah this may not qualify as the perfect answer but this somehow explains the situation happened with me which relates to this question. So. ## Here you go :D​​​​​​​ ## Technically this wasn't a comment in source code, but it's close enough and I think it fits the spirit of the question.I can't remember the game I was cracking. I was quite young and the old RAM gets a little unreliable, you know how it is.I think it was on the Spectrum. I'd made my own disassembler and was stepping through code manually and taking down notes with pen and paper. Suddenly there it was, unexpected text values in the middle of code. I printed it out:STOPFUCKINGHACKING!Needless to say, a message from the coder to me, or at least people like me. I was overjoyed. I felt childishly validated, like what I was doing was something people cared about.This was very encouraging and I buckled down to work harder than ever.Years later I found you could do the same on grown-ups computers with the strings command. People still left odd messages in compiled code. You could find undocumented functions by looking at lists of commands or error messages which didn't seem to relate to any expected functions. All good fun. ## Most of Engineering students can relate his comment with his own life.Most of my mid-sem exams were over and the only subject that I left with was psychology(yeah, B.Tech in CSE but still don’t know how this course will help me. :( ). So I switched to codechef and decided to solve problem. It is good practice to see the solutions of good coders(those with higher rankings) after your submission.This is something I encountered:-“THANKS TO RAGGING, THIS REMINDS ME OF MASTURBATION PER MONTH ;)”.Most of you(Indian Engineering Students) will be like, “Ye toh hamare saath bhi hua hai”.(Translation- Even we have encountered the same situation).P.S.:- I don’t encourage ragging but it is still important to some extent (Unless it is physical). Apart from interaction with seniors, it helps in developing the skills such as answering weird questions instantaneously which may come handy during time of job interviews. ## I was making a modification to a program that calculated benefits deductions. At that company, the benefits were quite expensive and the employees paid a larger than usual portion of the cost. Except for the executives.I found this put in by another programmer about a year earlier. Forgive the formatting, Quora doesn’t seem to like indents./*———————————————————————————-————————-*/rem - Calculate employee portion of deduction. Except for the high-and-mighty ;rem - Executives of course, God forbid they pay a fucking cent for anything ;rem - because that might cut into the cocaine, whores and Ferraris budget. ;/*———————————————————————————-————————-*/if $BenefitGroup <> “EXC” thenrem - Sucks to be you, peon! ;calc-ee-portion($BenefitGroup, #CovgLvl, :#EEBenDed);elserem - Woohoo! Fuck all y’all, more free shit for rich people ! ;#EEBenDed = 0;end-if;I thought it was hilarious and left it in. Apparently the new QA turd did not, because she saw the comments and told the manager. I had to prove that the previous version of the program had that comment already in it to avoid getting fired. Luckily I was working on a different part of the code so could plausibly deny having seen the comments. The guy that made the comments got fired that Friday. ## Well, this answer is not exactly about comments, but about coding. In my first project, an iOS application of a very popular Indian News Channel, there was a rule before giving giving builds. Now this is a long time ago. Almost 6 years. iOS 3.2 was the latest version. Whenever our company provided a build to the client, it was set to expire after 5 days. So, a standard check was done.. Coding was done in Objective C:------------------BOOL appExpired =........some code....;if(appExpired ){           [ NSString hahahahhaha ]; //will purposely crash now, will not use exit(1)}----------------------- Of course now a days we will get compile time error, but during those days compiler used to give warnings only and the app used to crash if an undefined method was invoked.  ## My personal favorite example isn't from any of the stated languages; it's from a device driver written in the VAX-11 assembly language for VMS.The instruction was a MTPR instruction that changed the interrupt priority level to IPL 3. I don't recall why the code was bumping the IPL, but one of the consequences of having the IPL at 3 or higher is that the operating system cannot service a page fault, and so any page fault at this IPL will cause the computer to halt with a machine check. It is therefore incumbent that the programmer ensure that all virtual memory that will be accessed while at IPL 3 or higher has already been locked into physical memory in order to avoid a hard crash of the operating system.The comment on this instruction was ""If the lightning doesn't kill you, the thunder will."" ## In the 1970s, Digital Equipment's DECsystem-10 support service periodically mailed out a publication that reproduced problem report forms as submitted by users together with DEC's analysis and response. In one issue the user complained that the source code file SPOOL.MAC contained no comments at all in the part of the code specific to paper tape output. The user then launched into a lengthy complaint about how necessary comments were for maintaining code, how irresponsible it was to not include comments, and on and on, probably using the word ""comment"" 20+ times. DEC's response was both irresponsible and memorable: ""No comment."" ## It was something like;'''Only God and I knew how this program was working when I wrote this program. If you ever attempt to understand how it does and cannot understandhow it really works, please update the counter below:timeWasted = 254 Hrs'''"
"/How-can-I-understand-thousands-of-lines-of-C-code-if-there-are-almost-no-comments-in-the-source-file"," Source Code,  C (programming language),  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","How can I understand thousands of lines of C code if there are almost no comments in the source file?","As others wrote, it is a tedious process of reverse engineering and refactoring. Use comments only to explain tricky parts of code. Analyze sections of code and when you discover what a variable is used for (say the variable flipper), assign it a meaningful name. As you proceed, the program will begin to make more sense. Sometimes your initial stab at a variable name won’t be quite right and you’ll have to refactor (rename) it again. As you see the structure of (longer) code you will see how it can be sectioned off. Comment sections that are logically cohesive. You may want to refactor those into separate functions (giving it a meaningful name). Make sure the functions you create have a single purpose.You’ll get it. Discover books regarding Refactoring. If you work with much old code, you’ll be refactoring a lot. :)It can be pretty challenging but feels rewarding if you succeed. I remember starting to tackle a 1200 line subroutine. Yep…pretty sick huh? It was exemplary in the number of coding violations. lol Eventually I gave up. It was just plain not understandable. I had not been the first person on that path. It was like Mt. Everest. lol ## Programs should be programs not code, and as Don Knuth says using ‘Literate programming’.Well written programs should be readable without comments. That applies to any language. That is the purpose of a language.C for maybe good reasons tried to have a succinct syntax, using mathematical symbols like { } instead of begin … end (although begins are superfluous). But this ended up with a cryptic ‘code’ look. Some people write their programs that way because it seems that is what the language encourages.Early sources of Unix (I still have a printed copy somewhere) were quite readable. In fact they used _ as word separators in variable names and not the horrible camelCase.Undoubtedly, questions like yours lead me to conclude that C’s crypticness has led to a generation of programmers who believe in ‘code’ rather than programs.Well-written and readable programs are most often the most efficient.The most I use comments for is if I found some obscurity which is handled in a strange way and I should document that to alert others, or remind myself later. ## Any really good programmer does NOT require comments. (specially if the code is well writen).even so not going to say it does not require time if it has no comment but i can say also that an almost good program with the wrong comment is even worst than no comment at all.in fact you do not even need it to have the correct variable names. (even if they are correct it helps).and also if you have that amount of code, you are going to have to take an entire day at least to understand it. as the same as if reading a book each line takes time. ## One technique I teach is to start commenting the code. Start with a single method and figure out what the interface is, and what it does. Then comment it all clearly as if you were writing the code correctly from the start. Then take another method, and comment that. If you find a section of code you can’t figure out, skip it for now and work on something else.As you get the smaller chunks commented, you can now start solving the bigger chunks or pieces you couldn’t understand before.At the same time you are doing this, refactor the code. Clean it up as you go along. And keep a history of your changes with a good version control system like Git so if you make a mistake, you can back it out.Really, it is a similar process to building a puzzle. You take it one small step at a time. ## If the variables, classes(if applicable) and methods/functions have meaningful names, it might not be that hard. These can at least tell you what the code is supposed to do, even if it does not exactly tell you how.That is where you can see if whoever wrote that code decided to KISS , or not.If none of this applies, good luck, you have just tried to read real world work from a junior developper! ## Debugging the code and understanding what is going on… it is a very hard work but you will eventually get it!I am not so keen on code comments because the probability of having them outdated is very very high, so I always prefer a very clean code instead of having actual code documentation, scenario that unfortunately is not always present.Read these C++ core guidelines that should be applicable to actually any programming language:https://isocpp.github.io/CppCore...So, probably as a by-product of your process of understanding the code, you could refactor it to make it easier to read and understand, and thus, easier to maintain too."

"/How-would-you-describe-your-coding-style"," Coding Style,  Computer Programmers,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","How would you describe your coding style?","Pragmatic.I’m a fan of functional programming, and I tend to prefer a functional style with an emphasis on avoiding side effects and limiting state mutations to a minimum. But I’m not religious about it. I do write classes and interfaces, and mutate state, when I feel like it’s warranted.I always write code with extensibility, scalability and reusability in mind. I write so that a competent developer would be able to take over my work even if I’m no longer there to explain it. But I don’t assume that whoever comes after me is stupid.I try to do things the standard way, but I may use esoteric concepts if there are strong arguments for it. In that case, I’m likely to comment on what I have done. Speaking of comments, I rarely write them. Only if I’ve implemented something in such a way that it’s really hard to follow the code do I comment on it. But I try to avoid that, of course.I don’t believe in TDD. Yes, you heard me. I write unit tests when I need them and when I have an automated build process. Yet, I believe that relying too much on unit tests is pointless, as it’s impossible to cover all the edge cases anyway. I also work frequently on projects where working prototypes need to be churned out as quickly as possible.Overall, I don’t believe in a dogmatic approach to programming. Hence, I tend to dislike programming languages and paradigms that force you to do things in a specific way. Ironically, Python is my favorite language, and one of Python’s principles is having one way of doing things. But I honestly don’t think this principle is strictly enforced in Python.I optimize for performance early and often. Part of it comes from the domains I work in. With machine learning, big data and real-time streaming analytics, I know that performance will inevitably become an issue.Lastly, I really like my code when there are lots of small functions that do one thing each. But who wouldn’t. ## Are you talking about how I write code, or how I solve a problem?My code-writing style is fairly standard, I think, minus the fact that I prefer using two spaces for tabs instead of four. I know I’m not alone in this, but I see a lot of style guides that ask for four and that just bothers me and I can’t place why. On basically all my personal projects the code is indented two spaces. I also prefer to place curly braces on the same line as a loop or IF statement.to clarify, I prefer to writeif(a == b && c != d ) {instead ofif(a == b && c != d ) {It’s just a waste of a line to me.If you’re asking about my problem-solving process with code then I think it’s fairly standard, but my brains the only brain that I’ve got so maybe other people work differently. I don’t think I’ve ever asked.Think about the information I get, and what I need it to be at the end.How would I, as a person, get this done?Can I directly convert that into code?yes: cool, try it out and see.no: hmm… maybe I need to rethink how I would approach this in real life…Repeat until problem is solved**or as solved as it can get. ## Minimalist, conservative, language-independentI make the minimum changes necessary to implement a feature or fix a bug, unless a good argument can be made. I want my code reviewer to fully understand what I did, line for line. I'm concise, not terse.I prefer to delete code, rather than adding new code. It's surprising how often the desired change can be attained reducing the total lines. Often adding more means covering up the root problem.I don't have any taste for idioms. I like to write my code in a way that programmers unfamiliar with the language would be able to follow. I only take advantage of special language features when I believe it makes the code more readable.Because I place such high value on readability, I'm light on comments. Generally you will get the point because the method or function name says it all.Regarding how I organize my code, I prefer flat architectures. I avoid inheritance, and would probably feel comfortable in a language that doesn't support it.I rigorously limit dependencies. My brain spins in circles and easily gets confused, and I have very low tolerance for wasting time digging through confusing code. ## Convention-based, consistent, self-explanatory, explicit, modular, abstraction-driven.Let’s go into details.Convention-basedI use many programming languages, and for each I follow the conventions used in that particular language or environment. For example, if it is JavaScript, then the the opening curly brace will be on the same line with the preceding keyword/statement, while if it C#, then it will go to a new line. For example// JavaScriptif (condition) {	// code} // C#if (condition){    // code}The same is true about the capitalization, casing, indentation, comments, etc. The main point is, if I write some code, I should not try to enforce the formatting that I like, but I should make sure that the others reading the code are comfortable with it, that’s why the conventions are.ConsistentBe sure to maintain consistency throughout the projects in the way the the code is structured and laid out, the variables, classes and functions are named, and the way the modules are organized. Following the predefined set of conventions and rules mostly covers this aspect.Self-explanatoryTrying to keep the code to talk for itself. No obscure variable or function names or twisted logic. Names should represent the purpose of their bearer, and the naming should not only be meaningful, but also syntactically correct (referring to the correctness from the perspective of a natural language). Wherever the logic behind some block might not be obvious, I’m adding a short comment with an explanation. Messy quick fixes (no source code is free from those) is marked with TODO comments, briefly explaining the purpose of the quick fix, when it was made, and a short description of an anticipated “good fix”.ExplicitThe control flow should not be obscured, and should be easily understandable. There should not be a possibility for accidentally missing a possible execution branch in the code during later edits. Some examples are// Having only a single return statement in each function// This is the way prefervoid GetColorName(int colorCode){    string result = ""Unknown"";    if (colorCode == 1)    {        result = ""Red"";    }    else if (colorCode == 2)    {        result = ""Green"";    }    else if (colorCode == 3)    {        result = ""Blue"";    }    return result;} // As opposed to multiple returns// Which I do not prefervoid GetColorName(int colorCode){    if (colorCode == 1)    {        return ""Red"";    }    else if (colorCode == 2)    {        return ""Green"";    }    else if (colorCode == 3)    {        return ""Blue"";    }    return ""Unknown"";}or// Always enclose single-liner body of the loops or then/else blocks// in { and } (or the languages equivalent)// This is the way I preferint result = 0;if (condition){    result = 1;}else{    result = 2;} // As opposed to this// Which I do not prefer (though it is shorter)int result = 0;if (condition)     result = 1else    result = 2Code should not be obscure and should be verbose. The point is not to show of as being a hardcore programmer who can write the code in the shortest possible way, the point is to write the code in a most maintainable manner, which will be easy to read and easy to modify either by the fellow developers or by yourself after a couple of months.ModularMake sure the code is divided into the modules that contain logically interrelated functionality. The modules should not contain things that “logically do not belong there”, or to say it in a more formal language, maintain high cohesion in the module.Applying the same concept on a more granular level dictates keeping methods short and focused only on a single functionality, and decompose the large ones into shorter ones that are focused only on one particular task. This also makes the unit testing easier and more meaningful.Abstraction-drivenConcepts should be abstracted to a reasonable level to make them reusable, interchangeable, and maintainable. Method arguments and return types should be the highest possible type in the inheritance hierarchy that does not affect the functionality of the method. For example// Method to sort a list of integers // The signature of the method can beint[] Sort(int[] numbers); // But it is better to have it asIEnumerable<int> Sort(IEnumerable<int> numbers); // Or evenIEnumerable<T> Sort<T>(IEnumerable<T> numbers)    where T: IComparable<T>;The methods shown in the above example vary very little (if at all) in the implementation, but from the usability perspective the last one is the winner.—————This is a high level description of the rules I’m following when writing the code. There are much more finer details, but the answer already seems to be too long, so this would be it:) ## Well, one can’t be objective talking about one’s own coding style.My idea is - have less code, but keep it readable by most of your colleauges.Another aspect - keep it flexible and testable.Meaning - no long lines of code, extract variables for each expression; give variable good names; split methods into smaller ones, with good names.If I see two lines of code that are the same, it means something needs a generalization - “extract method” is probably a good refactoring here.Less surprises, less experiments and exercises - more robust and clean text.Which does not mean I avoid monads, applicative functors, and all those FP tricks, toupling, currying, and the like. But I hate using, e.g. an IO monad just because it looks cool. It should look clean and be testable, first of all.It also means that I refactor all the time. Recently a friend of mine said that he does not have time for refactoring, he just writes code. I think he’s probably not very smart. Code is live. It dies if you stop updating it. ## Refactor-happy.I don’t really respect existing style or structure much if it seems ill-thought-out or haphazard. Every part of existing code that stands in my way when trying to implement things nicely or understand and reason about how the existing logic works is free game for refactoring.I fully subscribe to the Boy Scout Rule.That said, I’m careful to only refactor in bits and pieces and phases small enough that it is trivial to see they don’t change the underlying logic.If I need to change the underlying logic in some major way, I almost never start rewriting anything from scratch but gradually work the old code into a totally new form, shape, and structure as if it were modeling clay, turning it inside-out or outside-in in the process, if need be. But I will only put in my logic-altering changes when I fully understand what the old, now-restructured logic does.(No matter how messy the old code is, starting from scratch is almost always a fool’s errand; you would throw away all the thought and hard work that has gone into the existing implementation and will likely only introduce new bugs or alter expected behavior in unpredictable ways, while at the same time not learning anything from the old code – such as which corner cases it handled and how, or which ones it doesn’t really handle at all.) ##  ## Largely functional. Decently commented and documented. It tends to go into production in a slightly hackish and kludgey state, due to deadlines. The client doesn't give a damn about code elegance; they want their apps, dashboards and models now. But the code gets refined as time passes. I'm impatient and fussy about performance, so I make liberal use of Rcpp and libraries that speed things up. ## I tend to structure it and comment the heck out of itSo, for example, I may have one block of code defining all my variables. This block would have a comment before it stating that, and each line of code defining a variable would have a comment explaining what this specific variable does.The next block might be running some algorithm on the variables, and I'd have a comment before it describing the main point of the algorithm. And many or all lines of code in the algorithm would have a comment explaining the role within the algorithm that line is playing. That's especially true if I feel the algorithm is non-trivial.That got me through the coding for most assignments as an engineering major.If I'm doing full on object oriented programming for a larger project like coding a video game replica, I may well have several long files each encapsulating a major set of algorithms and data structures I defined. You bet that if that's the case, I'll write comments describing the files’ contents and the data structures, too.Yeah, I love making my code essentially idiot proof in that sense of so explicitly saying what everything does. That can be very useful if you ever want to look at the code again or want to make sure instructors so explicitly get what you wanted to do.Aside from that, I like structuring the code such that its control flow is pretty obvious and you have a sense that each section with comments before the beginning of does something different — the sectioning by adding whitespace lines really helps me skip past parts I already finished and zoom in on parts that still need work.I generally also try to know my programming language at least decently well so I can try to optimize my algorithms. I tend to also do as much within a method/function or loop that makes sense and avoid complex conditional branches as much as possible.I also tend to work very progressively on an algorithm, too. Like if I need to implement a clustering algorithm, I'll make sure I can even assign points to a cluster correctly before I then try to see if I can change the assignment. If I'll need to take into account distance between points for that assignment, I'll make sure my distance metric is reasonable first.I go for camel case or close to it for variable names for readability and I also tend to choose pretty descriptive variable names that go toward the slightly longer end in some cases. Makes me type more at times, but eases the conceptual load of trying to remember what variables are supposed to do.Now of course, I'm nowhere near a professional programmer at all. I mostly only do scientific computing, so I'm sure professional programmers may feel differently on some stuff. But I think I approach it very methodically and with an eye for avoiding problems. ## My coding style is probably best described as either :self documenting OOP using test driven design (if I am writing code that I think it will last)Rapid hacking (if I am writing code that i don’t really care about beyond the current day).The challenge is when code I write using style 2 is now needed in some form for style 1 ! ## How would you describe your coding style?My “coding style” is easy to read, and generously commented … But don’t take my word for it, see Weasels TNG (C Source) .c (a simple hack, exploring the plausibility of Richard Dawkins’ “weasels” program).For user documentation, see Weasels TNG (User's Guide) .pdf. The C source compiles clean with Microsoft C (under Win XP SP3) and with Tandem (HP) NonStop C (under OS series D or later). I have not tested with any other C compiler/OS (if you do, please share your results!).All freely distributable, under conditions listed in the C source.Thanks for asking, Jon! ## A2A - I try to follow the Java Coding standard as close as possible. I want to meld in to what everyone else is doing. One thing I do as quickly as I can is I try to get the “{}” symbols to a different color in the IDE so they stand out.I am a “Code as Design” convert. The idea that the product is the compiled byte code. The source code is the final design blue print for the “compiler factory” that actually manufactures the product.This makes it important to document, but you must document thoughtfully. Because documentation that isn’t kept up to date is worse than no documentation. And I always try to document “why” not “what”. The what can be gleaned from the source - unless it is very complex or unusual then “what” documentation can be important. ## Contained.First of all, I must say that most of my coding is in C, due to company preferences. However, my coding style is vastly different from the code I usually see. I create lots of libraries, lots of functions, and lots of structs. my functions are just a few lines long, and they do predictable things. However, most code I have seen in C tends to be much longer (and harder to understand, in my opinion)"

I generally like simpler and more verbose code than my colleagues. However, you should definitely follow the style of your teammates. If they use specific idioms, learn them and use them, even if you don't like them. The more your code looks like their code, the easier time they will have reading it.Now, occasionally, but far less often than people think, you need code to be written a specific way [which may be non-obvious and thus ”arcane”]. That is not an excuse not to make it as simple to understand as possible.For example, one of my last tasks at Intel was writing a specific version of a library that we hand parallelized to fully exploit the pipeline of the hardware. There were several versions of it, because different cases parallelized differently and thus had different levels of unrolling.There was one case that didn't parallelize at all. I used that as the base case. That code was the simplest. The more complicated cases were expressed as variations on the base case, so that future developers could see what they were doing simply first and then understand the wrinkles that the harder cases introduced.I also worked hard with the other developers to get the way I expressed the code to be as readable as possible, getting rid of macros that made things simpler for me, but made the code more ”magic” to them. This is one of the key advantages of code reviews. It gives you a chance to understand how other developers see your code.Remember when you are gone, your code may be all that is left to tell people what kind of person you were. You don't want them thinking you were a jerk who thought they were clever, but was simply obtuse. I have heard it said that:The true mark of genius is taking the complex and making it seem simple, ## I may have programmed elegant and arcane code:In my Fortran course the instructors gave assignments where the hardest part was getting the specified formatting in the printed output (x number of columns with centered titles) where x was given. I thought of how the computer would figure this out for any x and came up with code where x could be entered (for submittal proposes I coded in x as specified in the problem statement and commented out the user input statement). I did this by knowing the width of the paper in characters and directing the printing head to where I wanted it by finding the middle of each column and backing the head up half the length of the headings. The instructors code grade the students that brute forced their formatting be counting the number of lines in their listing. My code was normally 60% of the expected number of lines and I had to show the instructors how I got the computer to produce the run.In my Data Structure class we had to use a KD-tree to store and access an image stored by level storing the red, blue, and green magnitudes and changing which one to use for each level. My teammates did an extremely long method where they did three levels at a time to ensure proper alternating of the RBG nodes at the cost of not being able to search individual levels. I showed how to take the level number and mod it with 3. If the result was 0 (red), 1 (blue) and 2 (green) with a much smaller method.These to examples of what I would call elegant and arcane is because it was not obvious how the method was working. In a way this is what the computer does when it keeps track of all the variables in a object oriented language in the background. You do not know (or should care) exactly how it is keeping everything in a particular class instance in the program, but it does work.I was responsible for the development of Minuteman I R&D flight test target kits and that experience leads me to distrust both elegant and arcane programming. When the IBM computer had to be replaced because it’s MTBFs was shorter than the targeting times we had to port the spaghetti programmed (arcane) Fortran written to take advantage of IBM’s bells and whistles (elegant) to a different computer. It took a TRW design team several years (with an Aerospace design team looking over their shoulders) and over one million dollars to get it ported over in standardized well documented Fortran. The Department of Defense spends a large amount of its acquisition funds for the upkeep of the software in its weapon systems. The newest B-52 was manufactured in 1962 and is expected to be on the front lines in 2050. The software coders at that time also thought that they were clever and the code was clearly written and the B-52 would be gone in the 1970s. Now there is definitely a problem maintaining the software.You should always write your code in a self documenting way simply because tracking down which i, j or n is being used or what method x is or does costs to much waste time and errors. I had a Java instructor that showed that the compiler could keep track of a program called “word” using a class “word” with a variable “word”. How would you like to have to read and modify a program like that?Self documenting is a necessary, but insufficient way to document code for debugging and maintenance of software. Programs are a large expense in a project which can last for decades. Giving your variables names (unique nouns) and your methods descriptive names (explicit complex verbs with camel humps) goes along way, but does not show the next user how to use the method and there are many search methods as the stars out there. What we called javaDocs at the beginning of the code is helpful on showing what the method signature is (parameters in and output), but it does not explain the workings of the methods. I was the programming team leader of a robot lawnmower which had about 15 complex threadable classes with up to 20 complex mathematic methods in each class handling GPS, Lidar, embedded microprocessors, IMUs, etc.). This was a multi-discipline project where the teams changed each year. The javaDocs were extremely verbose on the method and what it was suppose to do, but it became clear that I had to flowchart every class because there was no description of the equations that were suppose to be implemented. There was also a lot of the one line Boolean branch statements that someone thought was elegant because it made the method appear shorter. These branching statements were buried in hundreds of lines of code which could be skipped over during debugging. Never sacrifice human readability for compactness, it never pays off in the future maintenance of the code.When I flowcharted the code (something that should be taught to programmers now) I discovered some major logic problems. One method was storing the last and current x and y GPS floating point numbers (8 floats for each), testing the each current float with its previous float and only if all of them were equal did the enclosed code get executed. Let me be clear that 8 GPS data floats had to be equal to their previous values for the inside code to get executed. There was no documentation to show that this was being done.I had to go through the code and reconstruct the equations that were being used and then tracking their outputs through the different classes to find if they were being used correctly. The use of internal documentation to identify what each part of the method does along with the equation that is being executed is extremely important for the continued maintenance and portability/reuse of the code. If you are proud of your work you should explain your brilliance to us lesser mortals. ## I would prefer well documented code that does not need to be touched. This is hard to write but very satisfying.If such code is “Arcane” in the sense of needing advanced knowledge of how the language is implemented ( for example how Java’s volatile works inside the JVM) it should be documented very well. The alternative is to point developers to the literature for that feature. If the literature turns out to be a masterpiece of obfuscation then you need to write your own simple explanation. If you cannot do that you do not understand it well enough.Unfortunately in today’s environment taking the time to understand in depth is deprecated by most managers and made harder by short deadlines like those pose by Scrum based methodologies commonly known as Agile. ## With every question about programming, same answer can be given: It depends.For years people point to Fast Inverse Square Root of Quake[1] for “arcane” (understood by few; mysterious or secret). And, it is …documented.And there is FizzBuzz, it is so simple, writing comments can be counted as insult. It is very verbose and almost always without any comment.And there also is Enterprise FizzBuzz[2] same question handled by enterprise developers so it is a prime example of FUBAR.If you are writing a game, and you need speed, lots and lots of speed you don’t just use sqrt, you use Q_rsqrt. It requires you to have a close knit, well communicating, all star developer team.If you are writing a general purpose software (LoB, web applications, mobile apps) you would want to write code that can be read as “How”, so a newbie can “read” how a particular problem solved. And you include trace amounts of comments to explain “Why” you have chosen to solve problem this way. And voila you have documentation in plain old Java (or c#, or python, … etc)If you are a pure mathematician and you need to prove 2 *2 = 4, you begin by defining a number set, and continue with defining multiplication function on that set. In the end you would have something like Enterprise FizzBuzz. Solid as rock but inaccessible to general audiences.As I’ve tried to explain the code I want to work on, depends on the situation.Most of the time my answer would be “I’d like to work on some code written by people who have been keeping Clean Code close to their hearts”.Footnotes[1] id-Software/Quake-III-Arena[2] EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition ## COBOL is self-commenting.That’s a joke, not a statement. “Self-commenting code” is a joke.Elegant code is very easy to read and understand (to a developer, anyway), if it’s arcane it’s not elegant.Very verbose, uncommented code is the opposite of elegant.My choice? Elegant, short, easy to understand code (with comments where comments are needed - error = connect_to_database(‘myDatabase’) doesn’t need a comment, and it’s understood that if error == 0, there’s no error.). ## Surprisingly, compilers don’t understand comments.I’m actually not a fan of comments, I would rather have unit tests. A unit test will show me exactly how the developer planned for the code to be used. As a developer, I can add more unit tests to show how I plan on using that code. If you modify the code and the unit tests start failing, it would let you know that you’ve failed at the Open/Close principle, and that you need to make new routines and/or go through deprecation processes.All that is way more handy than //This code does X Uh, yeah, but why did you make it do X? So if your comments say anything other than why the code is, you’ve messed up your comments.//This post lists the business value of unit tests in an effort to sway you to including unit tests//This post directs you to document why the code exists instead of what it does to better communicate the code ## All code is self-documenting - it’s always possible to sit down with a piece of code - no matter how badly writes - with a pencil and paper work out what it does (ok - *almost* always possible). It just takes time.So I’d we are talking about modifying a working program or converting it to another language, then I’d take the elegant, arcane and well documented code over the (intentionally or not) obfuscated code. ## If these statements hold true:The code is seemingly unreadableThe code is seemingly inefficientYou are versed well enough in the relevant language+frameworks to assert [a] & [b] in objective fashionThen the code is not elegant.By definition, if code is arcane then it is not elegant. ## Self-documenting every time. Explicit is better than implicit. Terse languages, and terse algorithms, are the worst to work with, because too much is happening in too small a space. There’s a lot that can and will go wrong if you try to change it. ## When I read a novel, I don’t need all the authors notes and chicken scratch to clarify or offer insight into what he meant on page 95 paragraph 4. I can just read the context and let the story tell itself. If I can get away with it, I’d prefer code that does the same. ## Self-documenting doesn't imply verbose. Good code is easy to read and easier to understand.Well commented only works until the first emergency maintenance request arrives, then it distracts from the truth of the current implementation. ## Well commented code.You can't write “arcane” code, it just happens the reader is not familiar with the syntax, library, or unaware of side effects, the machine knows only code that runs/compiles and code that doesn't, if the reader dislikes a specific syntax it's possible to rewrite and test the line in more readable form.Comments are useful to understand what the writer intended to achieve. What was the requirement. What was the supposed architecture. If that's undocumented, it only can be guessed, uncertainty is not productive or reliable.I can fix great comments(context) and bad code but I can't reliably fix good code without the right informations. ## Good code is short and free of any noise. Good code is self-documented because the names are well selectet. Less noise depends on programming language."

A huge amount.Here is the timeline:1969: The start of a project of the U.S. Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) that the protocols of the Internet evolved from.1974: The first Internet Service Provider started with a commercial version of the ARPANET project.1982: TCP/IP protocols were established.1983: The domain name server system was created.1987: There were 20,000 hosts on the Internet.1989: Twenty years after the Internet story begins, the first open source license (GPL V1) was created.The development of the standards and protocols of the Internet (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, FTP etc) and WWW (HTML, CSS etc) is governed by an international standards body and open source does not play a part in that.However, when it comes to the expansion of the Internet, open source has played a huge role. The majority of the web servers on the Internet are using Linux, Tomcat, PHP, MySQL, Postgres, Wordpress, and many other open source technologies. The expansion of the Internet to it’s current size would not have been possible without open source. ## Open source has not just shaped it, it has made the whole thing possible.Some 90% of the internet runs on Linux. Most of those sites are coded with PHP. All of those sites use JavaScript.All open source. Most of the apps available for your phone were developed on open source IDEs.To give you an idea how this works… There was a time when Visual Studio was very expensive. Developing a website using VB or C# with an MVC framework was pretty expensive. Especially since you need a Microsoft IIS server to deploy the site.They saw the flaw in that plan and now VS is free. And most servers allow you to deploy .NET applications. But by the time the saw the light on this, the internet was lousy with open source activity.In the end, I am a HUGE proponent of sharing knowledge and the whole open source idea. I share all kinds of stuff myself. I may not be the biggest contributor. But I try. And if someone learns some new stuff from the things I share then I feel good about that. Which is why, every time I develop something new, I write about it. And lately I’ve been making more tutorials for stuff. ## Open source coding has become the bedstone of the Internet. Without it, you wouldn’t have had Facebook, Snapchat, Uber, or any of the other startups, etc., etc., etc.Not only did open source coding dramatically reduce the costs of developing application code, but it enabled vast sharing and truly led to a global developer base writing code in cooperation across the entire globe.Frankly, from my experiences before open source coding, without open source, the Internet might never have developed, instead you would have continued to have small (and large) proprietary networks and software.It still boggles my mind when you think that 99% of the contributors to open source code reap little to no financial gain directly from their contributions. ## Without Open Source the Internet wouldn’t exist!Maybe there would be an (expensive and slow) Micro$oft Network. A horror scenario which we better won’t think of! ## The Arpanet network protocols and supporting software have been shared among the participants from the start, which eventually came to grow into the billions, in order for the nodes on the internetwork to communicate successfully. The term ‘Open Source’ was coined in the nineties."

Of course not.Honestly, if that were the case, I would expect this guy to pop up everywhere:Software is written in a specific context.Let’s assume the creators of the universe and earth are developers, and we are all just part of an elaborate program, here’s a bit how I see it would have started:Developer 1: “Dude, look at what I created!!!”Developer 2: “Man!! That is great!! That is aaaaaawesome!! …. What is it?”Developer 1: “Well … I don’t really know yet. You see those two elements?”Developer 2: “Ehm … yeah?”Developer 1: “See, I programmed them so that they are going to crash into each other!!”Developer 2: “Wait … You put in all that effort to create them … Just so they can destory each other? That makes no sense at all, are you just wasting time here? You’re aware we’re on a deadline, right? If the manager figures out you’re just doodling a bit, you’ll be fired for sure!”Developer 1: “No, seriously! You don’t understand what I’m trying to do here.”Developer 2: “I agree with you on that point. Dude, I don’t understand. What I do understand is that you need to have that universe up and running within the week. If you fail to meet your delivery, they’ll fire you for sure.”Developer 1: “Yes, but unlike all these other universes we created … they’re just lifeless pieces of spaces with some stars and planets in them .. I want to create a different kind of universe.”Developer 2: *SIGH* “Dude … Remember Derek? Remember when he thought it would be a nice idea to put rings around a planet? He now works as a toilet cleaner. Those ‘boring’ universes you talk about? They’ve been approved by management. They’re good. They’re safe. … What kind of changes were you thinking about?”Developer 1: “Well, I don’t know … I would like it to develop itself, sort of…”Developer 2: *SMASHES HEAD AGAINST SCREEN* “Are you out of your f*cking mind???? How on earth would you even unit test that? Writing a bunch of tests for functionalities that may, or may not, be in the final product. If they are developing the way you expect, what makes you so sure the functionality won’t alter? There is no way what-so-ever management will allow you to put an entire universe untested into production.”Developer 1: “Well … I’m going to do it anyway.”** YEARS LATER **Developer 1: WOUHOUW!!! Look at all these new creatures in my universe. Too bad most of them just flock around on that one planet over there.Developer 2: Shush you idiot … You are lucky management hasn’t found out about your untested experiment (yet). You’re making it to obvious you hadn’t expected these big animals and all.Developer 1: Yes, you’re right. Don’t want to loose my job, after all. But, after all, my idea worked, and I’m learning so much about this new world, it’s amazing.** YEARS LATER **Developer 2: Uhm … quick question. Don’t those creatures on that planet need that oxygen thingy to stay alive?Developer 1: Yes, why?Developer 2: And isn’t that oxygen created by those plant thingies?Developer 1: Yes, it’s a self-organizing system. It takes care of itself. When the big animal thingies die, their remains feed the plants, the plants allow those animals to breathe air. It’s remarkable!Developer 2: Yeah… and here is why we’re supposed to unit test our universes, dumb ass!! Your animals are eating the plants, so soon, there won’t be plants to create more oxygen. You should have thought about this.Developer 1: NOOOO!!! No, no, no, nooooo!!! … Damn, I’ll need to implement a bug fix!! I’ll add more plants, that generate more oxygen yet that taste awful, and, I’ll create new animals, that eat part of the existing animals. My_Universe 2.0 coming up…** YEARS AFTER DEPLOYMENT OF My_Universe 2.0 **Developer 1: Everything worked out, phew, that was a close one!!Developer 2: Sure, but you missed the obvious.Developer 1: Huh? What do you mean? The planet’s doing fine now, isn’t it?Developer 2: Yeah, sure. Problem is, you made your bugfix on the base planet object, not only for the instance ‘Earth’. See that causes changes in other planets as well.Now you see that rock being hurled towards Earth, ready to hit it?That wouldn’t have happened had you not screwed around with your base planet class. Once that thing hit, with this altered gravitation you put into place, the cloud of dust won’t be able to leave the planets orbit, blocking sunlight and basically killing everything on it. You had better be able to come up with My_Universe 3.0 really quick, or management’s going to have your hide.And there you have it. Evolution isn’t exactly fixed. After all, not all species evolved the same way. We also change our world, and our universe. If it was a piece of software, it would never have expected mankind to leave the surface of this planet, nor would it have expected our impact on the climate.Bugs would appear out of nothing, simply because evolution and our desire to ‘improve’ can not be predicted.If you had told anyone 100 years ago, there would once be a device you could keep in your pocket, which would allow you to speak to people who are at the other side of the world, they would have declared you bonkers, yet nowadays, cell phones, smart phones and computers are everyday tools.In the beginning of time, nobody could have foreseen what mankind would once use fossil fuels for, nor the impact of that usage. All of that would create bugs.Not necessarily related to the code, but simply because we behave in a manner they didn’t expect. ## Code is written to solve a problem, the universe just runs, well, poorly, not at all - it doesn’t care. It isn’t there to solve problems. There’s no aim, so what happens, happens, there can’t be bugs (which are parts of the code that don’t do what the developer wants). There can’t be any security, because there’s no part of the web “designed” to keep anyone out."

Key considerations are:ensure that all employees and freelancers have signed agreements (usually called intellectual property assignment contracts, sometimes they go by other names though) that give your company ownership of (not a license to) the code that they write and all other protectable IP, including advertising copy you use on your website, artwork appearing in your materials, etc. The single most common mistake I see with my tech clients is they forgot to have their personnel sign these things. It’s ok if you forget - all of this can be fixed after the person’s first day at work - but you need to fix this pronto if it hasn’t been done already.for vendors, typically you insist on owning the source code they write for you (plus all related IP, including object code, design assets, scripts and so on). But with some vendors — in particular DevOps consultants, these days — you’ll find vendors that insist on keeping ownership of their own code but instead giving you a license to that code. That is contrary to what companies usually want to do, but honestly, it’s often fine as long as you as the customer make clear in the contract that 1) you retain a perpetual, irrevocable license to do anything you want with it 2) you are clear on whether or not the IP contains any code published under GPL or any of the other copyleft licenses and 3) the vendor promises to comply with your confidentiality agreement when they re-use that code in the future.often the vendor actually needs you, the company, to give the vendor a license as well - this is a legitimate request, as the vendor usually needs to at least temporarily make copies of some of your code in order to do its work (otherwise they would literally be infringing on your company’s copyright).Chat with a software/business lawyer and you can get these documents prepared pretty quickly. But an easy rule of thumb is to not sign any agreement that says anything at all about intellectual property without running it by your lawyer. It’s really easy to accidentally give a company an irrevocable license when you meant to give them a revocable license, or give away an exclusive license when you should have given a non-exclusive license, or worst of all, give away ownership when you meant to license it."

I had one scenario where I was dealing with interpreted code in Ruby. I had the right Ruby version, all the relevant gems still existed, but they would no longer compile on my Mac after I had upgraded to Catalina. If this were a scenario with compiled and not interpreted code, then having a binary might have saved me some headaches.Now, you may not want to store those binaries in the same repository as your source code. You could create a separate repo for that. Or you could go old school and use a file store somewhere.

"/Is-Haskell-code-self-evident-or-does-it-require-inline-commenting-to-understand-the-coders-intent"," Code Comments,  Haskell (programming language)","Is Haskell code self-evident or does it require inline commenting to understand the coder's intent?","It can go either way.Haskell is a flexible language. It gives you tools to write eminently readable code—but you have to use the tools. This means most Haskell code should be self-evident. It’s definitely achievable by programmers with taste; in fact, I’ve come across modules where it was faster to understand the source code than the prose documentation!But the language itself can’t force you to write readable code.This isn’t unique to Haskell. No language will make your code clear if you don’t write it well. People sometimes say that Java or Python forces code to some level of readability, but I’ve seen enough Java and Python in the wild to know it’s simply something you can’t force. The details differ, but they’re in the same boat as Haskell or even Perl. (Yes, Perl!)But the details are different, as is the underlying philosophy. The approach in Python and Java tends to be about molding your domain to your language. There’s one way to do things and, as long as you do things that way, you’ll have some minimum level of readability—but it will always feel like any other Python or Java program.This is great if your domain happens to fit the language well and it helps you maintain a reasonable floor for code quality, but it also results in a low ceiling. If your domain does not naturally fit the abstraction capabilities Python or Java give you, your domain logic will be swamped in operational details. Sure, reasonable Python is always “readable”, but this means you can read how the code works as opposed to what the code means. You end up needing to reconstruct an understanding of the domain logic by understanding all the steps the program takes to achieve it. You have to translate from the how to get the what.Haskell is not like this. The priorities are inverted. Well-written Haskell makes it easy to understand what code means—or, at least, what it is supposed to do—sometimes at the expense of obscuring the how. I recently walked through a script I had written with somebody on my team who had just started learning Haskell, and that was his exact reaction: he understood what each part of the code was supposed to do, but couldn’t always follow how it did it.Most of the time, this is a great tradeoff. Unless I’m debugging a section of code specifically, I only care about what it’s supposed to be doing—I just assume it does it right. Haskell’s type system really helps; even if I don’t know anything about code, I know it typechecks which means that all the pieces have to fit together somehow. This doesn’t necessarily mean it’s correct, but it does give some minimum level of assurance.There are a few skills you have to pick up before you can comfortably read Haskell. Its syntax is fundamentally distinct from the vast majority of other languages. Once you have enough practice with it, though, it starts feeling natural—yes, even including the operators. (In fact, one of the core skills is learning which operators are there just for plumbing—if you assume all the plumbing is correct, you learn to ignore the operators on a quick reading.)As a concrete example, I know the $ operator is confusing to beginners. I leave it out when I write code examples in my slides for a talk. But once you’ve spent a bit of time using $ it becomes second nature—it becomes easier to follow code with $ than with nested parentheses. I’ve found this true with most of Haskell’s quirky syntax: it might be a bit weird at first, but it pays off. Haskell’s syntax isn’t perfect but it’s remarkably lightweight, flexible and expressive.Sure, the up-front effort needed to get comfortable with Haskell syntax is somewhat higher than Python. At the same time, Python’s readability is a bit overrated; there’s still an up-front learning curve, but people count it as “learning to program” as opposed to “learning Python the language”. And if you don’t start with Python, chances are you started with some language that’s largely similar.Once you’re over the hump, most Haskell code is self-evident. ## There is no such thing as objectively self-evident and obvious code. It depends on who wrote the code and who reads it.For example the same code with b c y functions, as mentioned by others, is either obfuscated or crystal clear, depending on whether you know about combinatorial logic and fixed point combinator, or you are a typical ignorant dev.If you even think about self-evidence then Haskell is a bad choice. You’ll end writing in moronic style and avoiding the better side of Haskell while getting bitten by its worse side.As for better side - lens library use profunctors and a trick using constant and identity functors to implement composable getters and setters.recursion-schemes use a representation of recursive types as fixpoints of non-recursive base functors.Which of the above is self-evident? And I’m not even talking about monads.Nothing is self-evident in Haskell because the other languages you know are either imperative Algol style, or impure eager ML-style languages. Haskell is completely new and foreign to anyone trying to read it, even if superficially it looks like an ML or Scheme. So if you don’t give a shit about Haskell (and seeing you talking about self-evidence means you overestimate your understanding of Haskell) then you’d end writing ML-style spaghetti code. Which is still better than Java of course.As for worse sides, there is an excellent test of your Haskell skills. Here is the code:avg x = sum x / length xIt’s both incorrect, slow and leaky. Try making non-leaky one-pass version of it using minimal strictness annotations.If you can’t make it in 2 hours or less then you probably don’t understand the problem of leaks in Haskell, so just use Ocaml or Scala to avoid this kind of stupid problems when it’s too late to change the language. ## As is the case with literally every single programming language, the answer depends! Just because it’s relatively easy to use the tools Haskell provides to make code as self-evident as possible, it’s up to you writing it to make it so.I can write readable C++, I can also write extremely convoluted C++. It is the same case for Haskell, and as an extreme example check out this from The Evolution of a Haskell Programmer:s f g x = f x (g x) k x y   = x b f g x = f (g x) c f g x = f x g y f     = f (y f) cond p f g x = if p x then f x else g x fac  = y (b (cond ((==) 0) (k 1)) (b (s (*)) (c b pred))) (eschews variables, if not obfuscation; all this currying’s just a phase, though it seldom hinders)heh.Of course, one can accomplish the same thing withfac n = product [1..n]Your choice. ## It probably depends on the way you code and the libraries you use. It also depends on how well the person reading the code knows Haskell and the libraries you use. Some concepts in Haskell are easier to grasp than the others, and some libraries may make coding patterns look alien if you are unfamiliar with them. ## Oh, you can write obfuscated code in any language. An example is the code from uncyclopedia’s article on Haskell.Here’s the code from that page.fix$(<$>)<$>(:)<*>((<$>((:[{- Jörð -}])<$>))(=<<)<$>(*)<$>(>>=)(+)($))$1			This is what it actually isy = map (2^) [1..]You can look at the following for a detailed explanation here : How does this piece of obfuscated Haskell code work?Here’s another one The Evolution of a Haskell Programmer.Now, the evolution page tells that there are as many levels of Haskell programmers as there are FP jobs available (kidding, guys! Don’t send me to the Monad Transformer hell! for this). So, comments will always be helpful as people looking at the code may not be at the same level as you are.The advantage of Haskell is that code can be partially self-documenting. The type declaration at the very least, tells what it expects and returns. Using common constructs like map, folds and filters provide further hints about the structure of the program. Proper naming of the variables and functions will further help and comments can clarify those convoluted bits of code.Contrary to popular belief, there is not a lot of difference between readability of modern programming languages (Python) and Haskell. It is just that Haskell is slightly easier on the eyes because of fewer character usage.Happy hacking and commenting!"

It is an unfaire game since Python is way older than Julia. However Julia has quite all what is needed for data sciences and can call Python and C/C++ libraries quite easily.Execution speed : here Julia win. There again, it is an unfaire game because Julia has the best modern JIT compiler on the market and can easily match Java speed and even sometime C. There is no possible comparison with Python.Development time : Julia wins by a short hand if you master the two equally. Julia is easier to read, write and has optional typing and other features that will speed up debugging on big programs. There is however compile times that take a bit longuer when precompiling new libraries.Readability : Julia syntax is similar to the one of Matlab. It is hard to be cleaner. Even if Python is very readable, Julia win here too. ## Julia is a way better programming language in any single aspects, no contest here. Python’s whitespace-based syntax is a disaster, it is slow like hell, it is a glue language for shorter scripts at max.Python’s libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn etc. are a well adopted in the data science community, and this mass has an inertia – why bother with Julia when the job can be done with Python, too?But it is just a matter of time until (1) Julia’s web frameworks are catching up with Python (2) educational materials (books, video courses etc.) of Julia are catching up with that of Python, and the industrial adoption of Julia can ramp up.The best tactics is to learn and practice both. Python is a must have in the present, but Julia is the future. ## Python…though Julia is a powerful and fast programming language compared to python, it can't overshadow python because of many reasons. Python didn't become a rockstar overnight, it was always there in academic and Scientific communities, getting matured and refined. It waited and waited for the right time and opportunity to come. Finally it's here. It's not going to go away anytime soon. Julia has to travel a long way to give python a hard time."

"/Should-TODO-comments-be-left-in-code"," Code Comments,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","Should TODO comments be left in code?","While I still have very little in the way of real world projects, I can still explain my process for development in College Computer Science homeworks. Before I do, let me explain something: I am a straight A student with a particular drive for efficiency (sometimes beyond what's practical in terms of the trade off between development time and time saved - College is the perfect time to practice improving efficiency because the opportunity cost to development is relatively low). When I work on my homework and projects, I typically can do the entire thing in around half the time of almost all of the students in the class.What makes my process so much more efficient? (Now to get back to the question asked.)When I develop any project, the sequencing of development typically looks like:Read the problemBrainstorm solutionsWrite up a simple framework (commenting all functions as I go with function input, intended process, and output)Develop from the most complicated back end to the front using TODO stubs and simple driver functions for testingFill in where necessary and run integration and regression testingFrom my experience, the two things that distinguish my development efficiency and accuracy are early commenting (I know the target solution before I start working) and TODO statements. As the question asked is about TODO comments, I will give my rationale on who I like them.TODO statements have 3 strong uses. The first case is simple, they let you know which parts of the code still needs to be implemented. This gives you an idea as to how much still needs to be done. Incidentally, that often helps me give better estimates for the amount of time needed for a project. Secondly, they help the testing process because it tells you which parts you cannot test yet. Thirdly, TODO comments let you break up your development time should a project be too large to do in one sitting (I typically draw the line at about 4-6 hours). Knowing where you left off and what you have left to do means that you can pick back up relatively quickly and have less time wasted as transition time in a project.The original question asked, however, is whether TODO comments should be left in code. At this point, the answer should be obvious: as you finish tasks, remove the corresponding TODO comment. If finishing a task requires that you jump into a different part of the code, leave yourself a new TODO comment so you remember where you left off. ## TODO comments in code are generally bad. If the code is so poorly structured that you need them and can't rely on the unwritten module being a module, the comment won't help. It's not guaranteed to ever be found.If the code is your own, refactor it to eliminate the need for such comments.If you can't do that but eliminate the need for the comment, eliminate the comment.Comments should be used to explain and specify details that cannot be deduced, thus document the code, for maintenance purposes. By definition, TODO statements can't explain or specify because otherwise you'd have written the code. There's nothing to maintain, which is why they're so easily forgotten. ## First as with everything there is no absolute canned answer.Each project, environment, and situation is different.I usually leave TODO comments in when I have a thought but not enough time to get to it at the time. If I am on a team or have some tracking app, I later use the automated recording to identify these items and task them out appropriately.If I am working on my own project I usually just leave them and get to them when I am ready, instead of wasting time on some tracking thing or some BS that way, though even on my personal projects I use Jira, oddly I find it worth paying for a personal Jira account.If you are working on a team, I would say before your story (assuming you are using agile) is marked as complete you convert all TODOs to stories.If you are cleaning up ugly code and your product owner is a prissy little guy that wants stuff turned out instead of done right, you may want to leave the TODO in so you can remember where the heck that code block was when the technical debt finally gets pulled in. This is a good tool when having to work with poor designs and crappy code (Unfortunately way more common than you may think.) Though I find in such cases, you often end up with a list of TODOs tied to stories that sit and collect dust.Another note is if you are cleaning up old code, and have a prissy little product owner, you will find it worth leaving little TODOs that you can pull in on stories outside of technical debt stories, so that if you happen to have some extra time in another story you can fix a couple.Each situation is different, each environment, and each team. Do what makes sense for you. ## If it's important enough to warrant a TODO in the code, then it's probably better to take the time to write up a proper item in the backlog/issue tracker instead of just leaving it in the code. That way a project manager will see it is able to make a proper assessment of priority.If it's just a small one-person project or similar, then fine, just leave it there. But as soon as it's a project with more parties involved than just the coders, then it really needs to be in an issue tracker or it will never get done. ## No.In my opinion, work in progress (WIP) should not be committed to your release branch. A todo in your code shows that your change is WIP. It suggests that you don’t have a complete/correct solution to whatever problem you are trying to solve.If you don’t have the correct solution yet, come up with a concise and complete solution before putting your code in the release branch.If you do have the correct solution, but you just need a reminder for the next step. Use a personal todo-list, bug tracker, or project management software.When todos are left in the code, and other programmers see it, it can often be confusing as to why the todo was left in. Is there a bug? Was it completed and they just forgot to remove the todo?Forgo the confusion and just don’t put todos in your release branch.But just to be clear, I do use todos as I’m developing in feature branches. I just make sure they are all removed before merging to the release branch. ## For sure.I use them often to remind myself (and sometime others) of things that should be done and aren’t done yet for lack of time.That being said, these TODOs should be resolved quickly.Otherwise, they should be transformed into proper issues (bugs, tasks, proposals, enhancements…) and tracked accordingly.For example, you can create issues using Bitbucket[1] and then manage them using Jira[2].Footnotes[1] Bitbucket | The Git solution for professional teams[2] JIRA Software - Issue & Project Tracking for Software Teams | Atlassian ## Yes! It helps you stay on top of things that need doing. But you have to manage them. Not everyone on your team will like TODO comments. Just keep this in mind and make sure you’re not disrupting the rest of your teams flow. I’ve been doing this for years and I know tons of other developers who do the same. TODO comments are a tool and can’t be inherently good or bad. It’s all in how you use them."

"/What-was-the-first-style-of-coding"," Coding Style,  Learning to Program,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","What was the first style of coding?","The earliest form of coding I can think of was done with punchboards. These were panels that looked like miniature switch boards. They had jumper wires going from one hole to another that caused data to be added, subtracted, or moved from place to place within some kind of logical space: memory, punched cards, internal registers, etc.Other computers used programs stored in various kinds of memory. The programs were written with a system of instructions where usually there was an operation code, and some references to memory, fixed storage locations or registers, and constant data in the instructions themselves. This became known as “assembler”.Assembler was augmented with “macros” that represented collections of instruction sequences that could be generated with a few variable parameters. There were also obvious subroutines written in assembler where a fixed sequence of instructions could perform a specific service, like determining a square root.The next development was libraries. These were collections of subroutines of functions such as things to compute trigonometric functions. More important libraries were those that would provide input and output functions to read and write data on devices.Those libraries were then used to form the basis for simple languages like Cobol and Fortran. The language statements often transformed directly and one for one into calls to library functions.Finally, in the late ’50s people like Knuth began to work on the theory of languages and their compiling complexities. The first important true language was Algol, later referred to as Algol 60.Once all the complexities of Algol had been worked out, computer scientists began to experiment with developing a wide variety of other languages, often special purpose things. Only a small fraction of all those experimental languages have had any lasting value. ## Coding language FORTRAN was invented at IBM by a team led by John Backus; it was the first widely used high level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper. ## Java SE5 or SE6 can’t remember exactly. ## With respect to modern electronic computers? The first style was simply entering instructions via physical switches on the front panel of the computer. This would simply be one long sequence of instructions.

"/What-is-the-difference-between-Pascal-Case-and-Camel-Case-in-computer-programming"," Coding Style,  Pascal (programming language),  Learning to Program,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","What is the difference between Pascal Case and Camel Case in computer programming?","It used to be the same thing, but now people seem to use the letter case of the first character to distinguish them.In most programming style documents, short but descriptive names for things are preferred. Something like “short descr name”. Sometimes names should be chosen MadLibs-style like <verb><descriptor><noun> (say “get complete sentence”).But, the programs that translate program source text to executable programs don’t work well with names that have blanks in them. This meant that the blanks had to be replaced with something else, e.g. a hyphen or an underscore: name-without-blanks, name_without_blanks.Languages that used infix minus signs in mathematical expressions (e.g. total-withdrawal) had problems using hyphens, so underscore became preferred. In some languages, underscore also had a special meaning, so the idea of medial capitals was introduced: nameWithoutBlanks. This became known as “camel case” since the capitals look like camel humps, I guess.Completely unrelated to this is the system of first-letter case conventions. Everything that has a local or transient value is written with a lower-case first letter, and everything that has a global value or is a higher-level abstraction (e.g. a type or a class, sometimes a procedure) gets an upper-case first letter. This, in turn, spawned sub-conventions like writing names of constants in all upper-case and parameter names in all lower-case. Initial underscore was used for “hidden” names.This meant that a camel-case class name would be written as FooBar, while a camel-case variable name would be fooBar (a constant: FOOBAR; a parameter: foobar; a hidden name: _fooBar).Pascal was one of the languages whose community embraced camel case (specifically, it was introduced in Modula-2, the successor of Pascal, and retrofitted into it). Note that this included the combined conventions in the previous paragraphs, with both upper- and lower-case first letter.And now, this convention has been “enriched” by explicitly naming the “greater name” style PascalCase. The “lesser name” style was called “droopingCamelCase” some decades ago, but now it seems that CamelCase is contracting to mean only that. ## Coding patterns change over the years... I will answer it with today and going backwards in time. In today's style of coding a variable name is much more description of its purpose, instead of A=""First Name"", we now name the variable First Name (without a space). With Pascal Case, the first letter of every word in the identifier is upper case (called Proper case), the rest lower case and merged without space, thus FirstName:='Ozz';With Camel Case, the first letter of the first word in the identifier is lower case, and all subsequent words use proper case, thus firstName:='Ozz';Now, there are businesses who implement a hybrid of this strategy, where variable names are ""Pascal Case"", methods are ""Pascal Case"", keywords are ""Lower case"", Definitions are Capital Letter ""T"" (for Turbo days) + ""Pascal Case"" and the private variables in these definitions are Lower Case ""f"" + ""Pascal Case"". thus:Type   TMyObj = class(TObject)      fFirstName:String;   {...}      property FirstName:String read fFirstName write fFirstName;   End;Going back to the ""Turbo Pascal"" days, the only change to the last statement, usually was keywords were Proper Case also, thus looking like:Begin   If MyObject.FirstName='Ozz' Then Writeln('Author detected.');End;* Note that Begin, If, Then, End were all proper case, prior to ""Turbo"" era as I call it, he style was all CAPS and indistinguishable variable names:BEGIN   IF A='Ozz' THEN WRITELN('Author Detected.');END;* This is the style ""C"" guys HATED - all CAPS. But, unlike their case sensitive world, our compiler didn't care about casing. And the benefit of using all UPPERCASE was a few milliseconds saved per line by the parser when it was doing a token compare of UPPERCASE to UPPERCASE, no need to spend time per token converting to uppercase. And in those days 4.7khz or (4,700 instructions a second (roughly)) was as fast as our computers went, now we have cores doing 3,000,000,000 (roughly) instructions each, so people do not focus on code efficiency as much.Ozz ## Pascal Case: This means that the first letter of every word in the name is capitalized. In Pascal Case if acronym exists in the word then only the first letter of that acronym should be capital. Eg: ThisWordIsInPascalCaseCamel Case: It is the same as Pascal Case, but the first letter of the first word is lowercased. Eg: thisWordIsInCamelCase ## At the beginning of my career I asked myself the same question. I googled the answer and tried to store it in my brain. And I succeeded for a few months. Then I had to google it again.So the real challenge is not finding the answer, but remembering it forever. So here’s what I did:Pascal is the name of a person. We know that the name of the persons has their first letter as capital letter while the camel is the name of an animal, so it is written with lower case letter as its first letter. So when in doubt, just ask yourself: “how do you write ‘Pascal’?”. Since you write it with capital letter, then this is PascalCase. The other can only be camelCase.I hope it helps. Happy coding! :) ## A2A: I had never heard the term Pascal Case before getting this question. It involved capitalization of the first letter of each unique word in an identifier, typically in programming. So: MyLongVariableName. This must be named as such because it was widely used in Pascal language programming. Camel case is where the humps (upper case) are in the middle: myLongVariableName. Some programming style guides distinguish different uses for each, for example, camel case for variables and object instances, Pascal case for class names. ## What people understand with these words is well described in other answers.I do however want to add two historical notes:Pascal does NOT define what is Pascal-Case.In original Pascal it is not possible to use Pascal-Case. Small capitalizations were used in publishing for readability, but computer implementations used all-caps. ## Very slightly off-topic, but…Algol was once also the language for publishing algorithms (~80 years ago), and that required that keywords be in boldface to not be confused with variables of the same name. The way you made them boldface was to repeat each letter with a back-space character between so when the file was sent to the printer, each letter would print twice, hence boldface. It could make compilers bonkers though, because you could type BEGIN_____BEGIN as well as B_BE_EG_GI_IN_N (“_” here means backspace character). Or so the story goes… ## Popular Case Styles:Camel Case: lorem ipsum dolor => loremIpsumDolorPascal Case: lorem ipsum dolor => LoremIpsumDolorSnake Case: lorem ipsum dolor => lorem_ipsum_dolorKebab Case: lorem ipsum dolor => lorem-ipsum-dolorCamel Case und Pascal Case are general rules for creating identifier names used in source code. In most cases Kebab Case can also be used for identifiers.Snake Case is not allowed in most cases. ## Pascal Case is just a subset of the Camel Case.In Camel Case:Except for the first letter of the first word, every subsequent word has its first letter capitalized. For example: `userAccountType`. Camel Case is generally used for naming functions, variables, etc.In Pascal Case:Unlike Camel Case, here all the words have their first letter capitalized (including the first word’s as well). For example: `UserAccountTypes`. Pascal Case is generally used for naming Classes, Filenames, etc. ## Pascal casing: usually used for writing class names. If you name your class with one or more than one word then each word should begin with capital letter.For example a class for finding students when you know their name can be named in pascal casing as FindStudentByName. Here you can see every word start with a capital letter. The purpose is readability and to make your code universally acceptive because for any developer developing in your language by seeing the name he can understand that this is a class.The other one is camelCasing. Purpose is the same as PascalCasing but the difference lies in the way multiple words are written. In camel casing the first word always start with a small letter and subsequent words start with capital letter. For example suppose we are making an object of the above mentioned class we can make an object findStudentByName. See here the first word start with smallcaps then the other words begin with capital letters. Try to write this with smallcaps (each word)then read it. You will understand how much easier the above one is to read. Readability increases when the code base is very large and the code is universally accepted because everyone else (who is serious about his/her work/ code) would be using the same convention and it becomes easier for everyone to understand what is written. Suppose you hire a new person in your team. If the code base is consistent it becomes easy for the new member to understand the code and follow the same culture and write good quality highly maintainable code for future reference as well. In my career I have maintained a lot of code which others have written and I myself have some coding experience. From that I can firmly say if you maintain a consistent code it becomes easier for you in the future to understand what you have written. Leave what others had written I am talking about what you yourselves had written. ## With PascalCase, the first letter of every word in the identifier is upper case.With camelCase, the first letter of the first word in the identifier is lower case, while the first letter of every subsequent word is uppercase. ## Microsoft PascalCase ∪ Microsoft camelCase = Regular CamelCaseAccording to: camelCasecamelCase (Camelcase, CamelCase, camel case, camel caps or medial capitals) is the practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter. Camel case may start with a capital or, especially in programming languages, with a lowercase letter. Common examples are LibreOffice, PowerPoint, iPhone or usernames such as DylanStuart.In Microsoft documentation, camel case always starts with a lower case letter (e.g. backColor), and it is contrasted with PascalCase which always begins with a capital letter (e.g. BackColor). ## PascalCase is a form of camelCase where you capitalise the first Letter. So in the practice you will find PascalCases mostly in class names.http://wiki.c2.com/?PascalCase ## Pascal case = upper camel case(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca...) ## Wikipedia saysCamel case may start with a capital letter (called PascalCase or UpperCamelCase) or, especially in programming languages, with a lowercase letter.Talking from a programmer's perspective, PascalCase means the first char should be capitalized while camelCase means the first char should be lowercased.In general both can be considered equivalent although by definition ""CamelCase"" is a valid camel-cased word. Hence, PascalCase can be considered to be a subset of camelCase. ## PascalCase is camelCase with the additional restriction that the first letter of each identifier must be uppercase.ExampleJava identifiers care about this distinction.Java class names are PascalCaseJava variables are camelCase ## Capitalization StylesPascalCasecamelCase ## Camel case may start with a capital letter (called PascalCase or UpperCamelCase) or, especially in programming languages, with a lowercase letter.Talking from a programmer's perspective, Pascal Case means the first char should be capitalized while camel Case means the first char should be lowercase.In general both can be considered equivalent although by definition ""Camel Case"" is a valid camel-cased word.

To the point you wind up spending more time fixing problems because you coded too fast rather than think about the problem, code a little bit, test, verify and move on to the next step.Writing lots of code without having a clear idea and purpose of what it is going to do because you think you might need it. Don’t write what you don’t need and delete what you don’t use.Often those who write the code the fastest in terms of time are those who are methodical and slow about the process. Classic tortoise and hare problem.Developers aren’t measured on how fast they write code except by idiotic managers. They are measured by the quality of the solution and how well it works and can be maintained. The best code is written slowly and purposefully, not quickly with the intent of meeting an arbitrary, unrealistic deadline. ## Some signs might be :Large numbers of syntax errors per line - by large I mean more than 1 per 10 linesLots of mismatched names for variables/functions/methodsLack of internal documentation (comments, doc-strings etc).Single letter variable names where they aren’t sensible.Significant numbers of simple logic bugs when testing starts.No single one of them is conclusive, but taken together they provide a good picture of a somewhat chaotic development process. ## You’re coding too fast if you spend more time editing and debugging your stuff and trying to figure out why it doesn’t work than you spent writing it.You’re coding at the right speed if it only takes a few minutes to get it running right when you finish.Of course that speed does vary from one person to the next. It’s the right speed for you."

This kind of licensing is sometimes also referred to as “copyleft”, which imposes certain restrictions, usually minimal, to protect the author, the software and the community behind them.First of all, the software as an intellectual property is still owned by the original author. That ownership is retained mostly to prevent other entities from claiming ownership of said intellectual property, as otherwise said entities could somehow revoke the rights granted by the open-source software license, rendering it pointless. So the ownership is not so much retained for the benefit of the author, but to protect the software and its community from unscrupulous entities.Secondly, although the author grants you a non-exclusive right to freely copy, modify, redistribute and use all or parts of said software for any purpose, you must still attribute ownership of the software and derivative works to the author (by retaining the copyright notice that is often attached to the license), and by consequence retain the original license in all copies and modifications that you retain or redistribute. It is not protected from copying (it is not meant to be), but it should be protected from plagiarism (like any other intellectual property).And finally, a word on derivative works. It only refers to patched versions of the original software, not to other software that makes use of the open-source software. If you copy, modify and then distribute your modified version of the open-source software, the modified version counts as derivative work, and must be attributed to the original author and retain the open-source license. The modified version is not yours (even if you have written a large part of it), so that you cannot claim ownership of the software to revoke the rights granted by the open-source license.On the other hand, if you write your original software that uses said open-source software as a component, they are to be treated as completely separate and independent artifacts. Your original software is yours and you do whatever you want with it. Yet the dependency is still not yours, and you must still attribute it to the original author and retain its original license.Now coming back to Node.js, it is a run-time environment and cannot be directly used to “design” an application (it is not a design tool). It is itself “server code”, and it being licensed under an open-source license means that it is not protected from copying, although it is protected from plagiarism, as discussed earlier.But your original applications designed to be executed within a Node.js environment are not part of Node.js, nor are they considered derivative works of Node.js, and therefore are not covered by the open-source license. You do whatever you wish to do of your applications, as long as they are indeed your original work. Just remember that Node.js itself is not yours, and you must retain its copyright notice and its open-source license, even if you modify it with a lot of custom code.And since you are free to freely use Node.js for any purpose, you can even legally profit using your own software even if it is using Node.js underneath, and you’d owe nothing (legally or financially) to Node.js authors and contributors. You could even copy Node.js to a thumb drive and sell it for profit (obviously pointless), as the license clearly allows that. What you cannot do is to say that Node.js (or its derivatives or plagiarisms) is yours to claim that nobody else should have the right to access its source or object code. ## No, it just means that the Node.js runtime is Open Source, it doesn’t make what you make Open Source.Most popular runtimes are Open Source these days, like Java, .NET Core, Go etc. are all Open Source but that doesn’t change the licensing that you choose to use for your project. ## Open source means that you can take the code and modify it oh, and you can get the source code for free. In other words, the code that runs nodejs can be modified with no problem. However, code written using nodejs is the property of the coder."

But the problem is that if the comments don’t match the code and are easier to read they’ll mislead you into making bad assumptions about the code.It is very easy to write bad comments. It is easy to let comments get out of sync with the code. It is hard to write good comments that are in sync with the code. This suggestsMake the code as self explanatory as possible.Use explanatory variable namesAvoid obscure or clever codeUse comments as seldom as necessary.Don’t explain anything that should be obvious from the codeDo validate the comments every time you modify the code they refer to. ## I’ve seen assembler where every few lines are commented with C code, and C code with English comments.I like to comment my C/C++ code with // every few lines briefly explaining what is going on — tell the story of the code as I write it.Some sections have multi-line /* */ descriptions at the top if it is complicated.I sometimes create a multi-line define with a descriptive name as a way to document some inline code.In Bash I sometimes use end of line `# comment` technique.In Dos Bat files, it will often use :comment which colors nicely in Notepad++.In Python, I use both # and ‘’’ comments.If I am writing something tricky, I will brag about it in a comment which both makes me feel good and also explains it to the next person.I sometimes ask myself, what would someone else think about this code and explain or defend it with some comments. ## Marty Fouts's answer to How do you write your comments inside of your code? covers most of what I would say.In addition the standard advice is the comments should describe the things that are hard to get from looking at the code itself. Chief among them is the intent of the design. Also anything that's tricky about the design.This also dovetails with Marty's advice, because while the details of the code may change over time, the intent will generally remain the same. And if the intent does change then it's usually much more obvious to the programmer making the change that the comment needs to change to match it. ## I favor the approach of Kernighan & Pike, in The Practice of Programming.They advocate brevity, accuracy, and the avoidance of unnecessary comments.The problem is that few are able to write concisely and well; it’s a skill mastered only with difficulty, and programmers are lazy bastards. Comments don’t pay."
"/How-do-I-write-code-requiring-no-comments"," Comment (computer programming),  Computer Programmers,  Software Engineering,  Learning to Program,  Writing,  Programming Languages,  Web Development,  Computer Programming","How do I write code requiring no comments?","Use better names and clear structures. Refactor ruthlessly all the time towards this.Key techniques are:Extract commented block as method. Convert comment to verb-noun nameExtract explaining variableSingle responsibility principleHere’s a quick example// Store Person’s name and current ageString i[10];int a[10]; // add person ‘Alan’, 19 years oldi[0]=“Alan”;a[0]=19; // add Bob, 27i[1]=“Bob”;a[1]=27; // track end of arraysint end=2; // find and print age of Bobfor( int j=0; j<end; j++ ) {  if ( i[j].equals( “Bob” ) ) {    System.out.println( i[j] + “ is age “ + a[j] );    break;  }}Now, there’s a lot you can say about that example code. It’s just that all of it is bad.Without comments, that code is hard to read because the code itself mixes up ideas, it is too specific, it mixes up mechanism with subject area and the names do not reflect what anything does. It has zero structure.Let’s fix that.We’ll replace parallel arrays with a single collection. We’ll co-locate name and age into a Person class. We will give that some behaviours.We’ll extract some methods based on our existing comments.We’ll split out some responsibilities.class Person {  private String name;  private int age;   Person( String name, int age ){    this.name = name;    this.age = age;  }   boolean isCalled( String targetName ) {    return name.equals( targetName );  }   void showDetails() {    System.out.println( name + “ is age “ + age );  }} Person findByName( String nameToFind ) {  for ( Person p : people ) {    if( p.isCalled( nameToFind )){      return p;    }  }} private List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>(); people.add( new Person( “Alan”, 19 );people.add( new Person( “Bob”, 27 ); Person result = findByName (“Bob”);result.showDetails();The calling code is more intentional. Names describe what a caller can expect as an outcome. Mechanisms are pushed into the background - like variable ‘end’ is now pushed into standard libraries.There is more code because we have spent more time explaining what our code is doing and more time splitting it apart.These are the kinds of techniques to use all the time as you develop.AskWhat is the outcome?Why would a caller use this?How can I hide the mechanics and promote the problem domain?Let that steer names and structure ## Your question shows that you have a desire to learn how to write what is known as clean code.Clean code is very neat, compact and functional, while maintaining readability. Another way of stating this question is, “how do I write self-documenting code?” For either of these questions, it’s very simple. Just follow some basic rules for writing your code…Use appropriate and descriptive class, variable and method names. If you give your classes, variables and methods descriptive names, which might be longer to type, but describe what the class, variable, or method, is/does, you will not need to include as many comments.Make sure methods only do one thing and do it well. If your methods are going beyond, roughly, 5–10 lines of code, use multiple if…else if…else blocks or switch statements, you could probably break out the functionality of that method into two or more methods. Never have a method do more than it absolutely has to.Make sure your classes describe one, and only one, thing. For example, if your program deals with storing information about different types people, and these multiple types of people have similar features and dissimilar features, take all of the similar features and create an abstract class. Then, create a subclass for each type of person that allows you to provide and access the dissimilar features.Use interfaces whenever possible to guarantee the functionality of an object. Going back to the people example, all people have the ability to walk, talk, eat and sleep, but very on language, food and sleep-cycles. Therefore, create an interface that provides the contracts for these actions/abilities and implement that interface in each of your people subclasses. This way, your program will know what actions people can take, without the need of knowing the implementation of how those actions are performed.When creating instance of classes, create them of the class needed, but reference them as their superclass. For example:List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();I could write an entire book as an answer to your question. However, I don’t have to. Instead, I’ll just refer you to the excellent book, Effective Java, by Joshua Bloch. This book will teach you how to get to the point of writing clean code by teaching you how to, as the title is clear in explaining, write effective Java programs. It’s well worth the investment and every Java programmer should have it at hand while writing code. It is an excellent reference.I hope this helps you out. ## All code doesn’t “require” comment. Anyone who said to you otherwise, probably implied that your code is unreadable or hard to understand because of poorly named variables.Although a general rule of thumb is to write code with variable names that are self-explanatory (i.e what data it represents and what is its type), anything else is subjective. It’s entirely possible that your boss who demands that you write comments everywhere is a moron. That’s because there’s no limit to how much comment you can write. For all he cares, you could write a comment everywhere, explaining in detail the step-by-step execution of each function; and it is still possible for your boss to not understand what you wrote.So, a good next step to take after making sure you name your variables well and write enough comments to satisfy you, is to get better at writing in general. Follow your middle-school teachers’ advice. Read. Practice writing. Learn to express your thoughts clearly. The better you write in English or any human language, the better you can code. ## How do I write a code that is not required to comment?Sean Carrick provides a lot of very good advice for how to write code that has fewer comments for explaining how the code works.If you write clean code, the code should be explaining *what* it’s doing quite nicely. However, that won’t explain *why* certain design choices were made, or why otherwise inexplicable things happen in the code.So - examples of the sorts of comments I’ve left in code:(In a program that scheduled making duplicate copies of backup tapes)// We do it this way instead of the obvious way because the obvious method// will attempt to request more tape drives than can be physically installed// in an ZZ700 tape library and then hang because it can’t get enough drives.// Yes, the vendor knows, and no, they won’t fix it. So we need to artificially// throttle the requests.(In a chargeback routine)// Yes, this is a capex expense, not an opex expense. But for this charge group, there’s// a special MOU that cost-shifts capex and opex due to the terms of a research grant.(In software that dealt with physical hardware)// We do this check because EX9934 controller cards with EC levels between B08 and// EC7 have a timing glitch that causes an incorrect status to be posted.Comments should rarely be needed to explain the how the code works.Comments are *often* needed to explain why the code is interacting with external issues in specific non-obvious ways. Use *that* type of comment liberally, so that the person who has to maintain this software a year from now will understand the choices you made.Because that person may be you. ## How do I write a code that is not required to comment?Mainly two things:Use speaking names. For classes, for methods, for fields, for local variables, for everything. If you explain the code, the names should fit into your explanation as consistent parts of the sentences, because people who read the code form this kind of explanation in their head and the more consistently the names fit into that explanation the easier the code is to read and the fewer comments you will need.Keep your code artifacts short. Human cognitive abilities are pretty limited. We usually cannot capture more than a few entities at once without starting to group those entities in our minds. This can become pretty tedious and makes understanding things more difficult. The shorter you can keep your code artifacts, especially methods, the easier they will be to understand and the fewer comments you will need. A good rule of thumb is the so called “Rule of 30”. At most 30 lines of code per method, 30 methods per class, 30 classes per package, 30 packages per module and 30 modules per project. I personally find 30 lines of code per methods too long and try to keep to 10 lines of code per method.With those two simple rules you usually don’t need any comments in method bodies. You should not have to write comments about what you are doing, but sometimes you will have to write comments to explain why you are doing things the way you do. If you e.g. have to use a workaround, you should write a comment that explains what kind of behavior made that workaround necessary. That way you and other developers know about a weakness in the software that might otherwise go unnoticed.With some practice you will learn to write that kind of code from scratch without having to refactor much. In the beginning you will almost certainly break those rules routinely. You should therefore refactor your code ruthlessly and regularly. I usually refactor before my code is merged into the main branch. As long as it’s in my branch it’s only my mess and only I have to deal with it. When it goes into the main branch, it’s everybody’s code and I would not want others to have to deal with my mess.You however should still use class and method comments to be able to automatically create API documentation. But those rules usually lead to no comments inside of methods. ## In addition to Alan Mellor's answer to How do I write a code that is not required to comment? I want to add another important skill, even if you do comment.Comments are for ‘why’ not ‘what.’So not.//before x is 5x = 5//now, x is 5Instead//I'm making a point using codex = 5//There's some code, but the focus is really the commentsor//I need to debug something a few lines down//TODO: Delete the next linex = 5//TODO: delete the previous line after this is debuggedBut you know what works a lot better than that? Test driven development and behavior driven development.// Ticket-32In order to provide a clear tutorialgiven i have set up variable x  when i set x to 5  then x should be 5 // We're sorry princess, the fixtures are in a different castleSo the ticket-32 links back to the ticket tracking system that justified the need for the code at all. The ‘code’ is loosely cucumber, which is intended for reading and providing clear preconditions. And most importantly, it translates by code directly into unit tests by way of the fixtures. If the tests fail, they point you toward other parts of the system which might be affected. Which means you don’t need to keep all the code in your head.Are the tests a lot bigger than a handful of comments would be? Yes. But they are also in a different file and totally actionable. You won’t ever be accidentally left with://before x is 5//after x is 5"

It is as true as I can remember, consider that it caused me permanent head injuries, other symptoms, and almost cost me my life.In September of 1991, I had gotten off the subway train to go to my car in the commuter section of the parking garage on the upper floors. It was still fairly light outside. I was wearing a midi-length full-skirted pink dress and a black jacket. Blood shows up well on pink.A young-looking teen came up to me while I was walking into the garage to get to the elevator. He was carrying a skateboard at the time, and I thought that he was waiting for an adult to drive him home. He came up to me and asked for a quarter. I was carrying a lot of stuff, and couldn’t even reach my purse, but was pretty sure that I didn’t have a quarter. I told him that I was sorry, but that I didn’t have one.He followed me into the elevator, and after I’d pushed the button for my floor, waited for the doors to close. It was just the two of us in the elevator, and I didn’t feel the threat immediately, which was a mistake in my judgement. He had such a young, almost pretty face, with no facial hair, no pimples, no scars. Perhaps that was part of the problem—maybe he was being razzed by peers.He pulled out a gun that reminded a little of the toy Roy Rogers guns neighboring boys had had when I was a little girl in the late 1950’s to early 1960’s. Initially, I remember saying, “Look kid, don’t do this. It’s a mistake!” These two statements seemed to infuriate him. He was even more infuriated when I told him that it was a fake gun. I was very tired and exasperated.In the interim we were at the entrance to my floor. There were only two cars left up there, mine and that of another commuter. I believe that there wasn’t even a fire alarm to pull. I didn’t feel the threat immediately and am not sure exactly when I said the very stupid comment, “That’s a fake gun!”His next words were very chilling. “You won’t think so when I pull the trigger!” I didn’t feel that I could stay in the elevator with him, couldn’t get away from him. I was holding office manuals because I planned to do some research at home. My arms were frozen around the books in a strong mesh bag and my purse, and for some reason, I couldn’t or wouldn’t let go.My car was a compact stick shift with a lot of stuff in it. At first, he said that he wanted my keys, and I wouldn’t give them to him. Maybe for a while my arms were frozen around everything in them.I can’t remember the exact order in which everything happened. I was terrified. At one point while holding all this stuff, I still managed to get the gun away from him and point it away from both of us. I tried squeezing the trigger, and nothing happened. I was initially relieved, but the relief lasted only a few moments. This teen was wirier than I, and about three or four inches taller than I was.A struggle ensued, and somehow, he managed to get me down on the cement floor. He managed to yoke one arm around me. It almost seemed as though he had at least three hands at times. He alternated between punching my lower face and beating my head against the floor and the wall. Filthy words spewed from his mouth. Nothing but sexual words! I believe that in his view, any woman who looked like they might be weaker than he was could have been his target.Much of the time he had me down on my knees on the floor, yoked around the neck, and alternately punching me, and pounding my head against the floor. At that point, my main weapons were my loud voice (I’d taken classical voice lessons and could really bellow) and teeth. Sometimes, I would manage to escape him for perhaps a few seconds, but he always caught up. When he realized that he couldn’t drive the car, he wanted me to drive him somewhere (or so he said). I remembered that a popular talk show host had had someone on as a guest who said, “Never let someone move you to another location. Your chances of survival go down…””I thought about Mom who was recovering from a stroke in one of the hospitals a county or two away and thought that if I was killed in the garage (raped or not), it could possibly kill her. Somehow, I managed to keep from losing consciousness. I really wanted to think that this didn’t go on for more than 15 or 20 minutes.Eventually, someone sent an elevator from one of the other floors. I heard the ding of the elevator and thought that if I didn’t get away from him in that instant, I was going to die. I might be raped while unconscious or after I was dead. I bolted for the elevator, while throwing the keys at him. I think I still had all or most of the stuff in my arms.I remember hearing him shriek, “You come back here!” I remember thinking something like, “Yeah, right! I don’t think so!” I threw my keys, which had my work badge at him and ran for my life to the elevator during this time, still schlepping the books that seemed frozen in my hands. The elevator was slow in its movement down to the street level. I was afraid that he would be waiting for me, his victim and witness right outside the elevator door that was at street level. He wasn’t but it didn’t mean that I was safe yet.It was at least deep twilight. I didn’t realize yet that my dress, arms and face had a lot of blood on them. I tried to get the few passing cars to stop for me, but they didn’t. I thought that I must look like a half-done Manson victim.I ran across the street, and up the driveway to the local grocery store. At that time, there was a bank of pay phones before you got to the store entrance. I don’t remember whether it was a man or woman on one of the phones. The person took one look at me and told the person they were on the phone with, “I need to get off the phone right now!” I believe that he or she then dialed 911. I was hyperventilating, partly due to pain, and probably partly due to shock.A few customers came out of the store, took a look at me, and went back in to get an employee with paper towels and ice. The employee did his/her best to tend to me. An ambulance and one or two of the police arrived. They were doing their best to try to get me to stop hyperventilating, but it seemed to help with the pain.Emergency vehicles don’t take you where you want to go. They take you to the nearest hospital. The police had found my keys and ID and kept them for evidence.The emergency room didn’t seem to have a lot of people in the waiting room. They kept taking x-rays, misplacing them, and forgetting to do things like take x-rays of my skull. What I still consider to be some negligence on their part is one of the reasons that I hate this particular hospital. I gave them my parents’ home number, and my home number. I said, “You need to reach my roommate! It’s not fair in case somehow this guy finds his way to my apartment!” I didn’t know at the time that they had my keys and my ID card for evidence.They reached my Dad and told him that I had been assaulted. He came to the hospital and took me to their place in a seniors’ community to an attached single floor dwelling.The next day, I insisted that he drive me down to my workplace so that I could return the copy of the manuals. I was still wearing the same bloodstained dress and had bruises all over my face. Someone came down from my office and got the manuals from me. Everyone was staring. Dad took me back to his place.My supervisor was angry at me concerning the manuals, and because I had upset the employee who “had to see me like that”!It took the police at least four or six weeks to have me work on a composite sketch because the computer program for generating a composite was broken. It was still broken when they had me come in. They worked with transparencies. They showed me many mug shots, and I was mainly able to eliminate people based on proportions of head to neck and shoulders. I was always right on the eliminations. No one seemed to have the almost pretty face. We couldn’t get the nose just right with flat transparencies.I was also given a number for victim counseling. The woman doing intake for the county program asked which program I wanted. It seemed to fit a few categories, since he tried to rape me, kept trying to pull up my dress from behind while he had me half on the ground. I kept trying to pinch his crotch. The intake person, said, “Well it’s not like he actually raped you! I’m putting you in the other group!” The remark was adding insult to injury, and I reported her insensitivity to one of her supervisors.It was eventually arranged for me to go view a lineup in out county seat, Rockville. I was scared even though they said that I couldn’t be identified. I thought, “What if I pick the wrong guy? Suppose it’s an off-duty police officer?” I couldn’t be sure and picked no one. I kept asking the police if they wanted my dress and jacket. I had to force them to take my stuff.It was at least a week to a week and a half before I could get my keys back, and for one reason or another, my roommate and I couldn’t connect for me to get into the apartment (no romantic relationship). Dad went out and bought me the wrong size underwear, and everything of Mom’s was too big. It took us over a week to tell her what happened.In the interim, I was afraid of almost all males. Not Dad, not my roommate, and not anyone in just about any kind of uniform, including doctors. It didn’t matter what their race or age was. I was angry at and afraid the kid who almost ended my life, and it made me afraid of almost every male with whom I came into contact for what still seemed like a long time. Due to the young monster, I have permanent head injuries combined with post-concussion, frontal lobe disorder, and PTSD, with a high startle response. I also developed an OCD that took a long time to diagnose. I am not going to say what it was. I still have most of these conditions today. Initially, I told the police that I thought that the attack lasted around 15 or 20 minutes, as no one wants to thing about something like that going on for around 2 to 2–1/2 hours.People told me to get mace (illegal in Maryland) or a gun (which I was still fairly sure I couldn’t kill someone with, in which case, the weapon could have been turned on me). I settled for pepper spray.I utilized the services of the state of Maryland as best I could to try to retrain my permanently head-injured self to whatever state my new normal was going to be. I saw a therapist, and she was intimidated by supervisor into suggesting that I return to work earlier. When the therapist told me that, I got a new one.My agency put pressure on me to return to work full-time, and I caved. It was that or eventually be fired for not being able to do my job. On some levels, I felt failed by the police, my agency, and my family. My roommate and some of my friends didn’t blame me. My family didn’t understand my fear of parking garages. My office didn’t understand my PTSD, and had my supervisor lied to me about putting me in for the leave donation program. I had no choice but to return to work much earlier than I was ready to—either psychologically or physically. I went on temporary assignment to the only office that was [reluctantly] willing to take me. At one point in the interim, one of my female colleagues asked me about the assault. I was frank with her. She repaid me one day by coming up behind me in an empty hallway, putting her hands around my throat, and squeezing. I went off on her. I didn’t report her because she left no outward bruises, and it would have been my word against hers.Over the next approximate 14–1/2 years, I worked in a hostile environment. When I was on temporary assignment there, my supervisor from the other office used to have adverse action letters delivered to me towards the end of the day on Fridays or right before a legal holiday so that I could stew over them for the weekend.At one point, I began having panic attacks, which took a few years after my disability retirement to end. I would often get them driving home from work (I no longer took the subway for years). I had many battles with managers and supervisors in an increasingly hostile workplace over the years. I drafted a lot of the responses that were eventually filed by a law firm. No legal action could be taken against the owners of the garage, whose employees lied about its ownership.Someone referred me to the amazing Roberta Roper. We have her to thank for many victims’ rights both in and outside of my state. I found out that you can’t sue owners of a parking garage for neglecting the safety of its users. I believe that they should at least be required to put up signs that say “Not responsible for your safety while you are in this facility” or something similar. That will never happen.I eventually overcame my fears of parking garages enough to park in them. I try not go to Wheaton any more. I retired on disability in May 2005. The office administrator made my last day a living hell, made me cry all day, and I kept calling his supervisor. Eventually, he had to type and we had to sign an agreement. He wasn’t allowed to continue to try to coerce me into signing a backdated unsatisfactory rating or to continue with some of the threats he made.There was no non-disclosure agreement. I did my best while my accommodations were pretty much ignored by my agency and am not sure that all of my supervisors even saw the documentation of my disabilities over the years. The first words out of this man’s mouth the day that I met him were, “I’m here to get rid of you!” It took him about five years or so, but it wasn’t fully on his terms. He couldn’t get OPM to change their minds about my retirement. I wasn’t allowed to have a retirement party, although there were many people who would have come if it hadn’t been banned.I can park in parking garages now, and have gotten over the panic attacks, while driving. I no longer take anti-anxiety medications. I lost 40 lbs. my first year after retirement, and subsequently lost another 20 that I’ve kept off—not an easy feat! I no longer wish that my former office director was in hell, although I am glad that there were very few people who wanted to rehire him after he retired. On one level justice prevailed. While I was working, my Mom, sister, and Dad died.Some of the physical and psychological/emotional issues have dissipated. Some just submerged. The teen wasn’t prosecuted in my case because I couldn’t identify him. I came to eventually believe that the police didn’t do such a great job of investigating my case. They probably could have taken me to another county to use the composite-generating computer program. I don’t hate police. I like and respect many. I just don’t like those particular police—for not doing their job properly.For the most part, many of my attitudes towards life have changed. So have my attitudes towards most men—generally for the better. I try to look for positive things about people. I haven’t worked in any official capacity since my disability retirement in May 2005. However, I have done a variety of official and unofficial volunteer work over the years, and at one point was trying to work towards a degree in computer management. With accommodations, it was taking too long, and that program was eliminated.I like to think of myself as an eternal or perpetual student. Most of the time I am able to take classes, and I audit them. I am also a survivor of stage 0 breast cancer. I believe in ending contact with toxic people.I never saw my attacker again after that late September night in 1991, never got to have my day in court. Never got to tell off any of those people who failed me.However, in my own way, I try to encourage and coach other people. I try to help people I see as underdogs with any wisdom and knowledge that I’ve gained over the first 66 years of my life. I recently found out that my intervention to help some young women with handicap accommodations around four years ago at one of the local colleges has helped. I sometimes tell people to look for the accommodation’s forms, attach and submit the documentation to the counseling office. If they don’t have a counselor, to get one.Sometimes people truly need a little or a lot of assistance. I had a conversation earlier this week with an 18-year old who has ADHD. He works at one of my favorite grocery stores that has rooms where you can do a limited amount of reading, studying, and computer use, in addition to eating.We spoke for over an hour and have some similar views. I gave him the benefit of my experiences with disability accommodations and a little advice about some other things he asked. He was actively listening the entire time and told me that I had alleviated some of his anxiety. Sometimes, all of us have to step up to the plate and help others. If you are unwilling to try, please don’t do damage to someone who needs help. Be honest and try to refer them to someone who is willing to try someone like me or one of any number of people in the world who care about others.I realize that this is probably a more detailed response than you wanted, E. Subhaan. I wanted to show where I was, some of what I went through, and where I am almost years later. I have no idea of what happened to the young teen who assaulted me. My anger hasn’t totally dissipated towards him.I have many “why” questions that will never be answered by him, the police “involved” in the case, or with the people I worked with then and in the aftermath of this and my colleague’s assault. I am still in touch with a few friends and former colleagues from my former agency. Most of my friends are friends that I made subsequent to my retirement. I have had to divest myself of the toxic ones.I hate bullies and am trying to help someone file a retirement application to get away from one. I look at people with different eyes and am unconsciously trying to find something genuine to compliment another person on. It is a mutually beneficial way of living one’s life and makes me feel better. I was 38 at the time of the assault, I was 38. I turned 66 yesterday.Like everyone else, I have problems, some of which are medical (related and unrelated to the assault). I am in many ways a better person than when I was working. Most of it is due to people who are/were professors, friends, potential friends, and people of a variety of ethnicities and ages in a variety of walks of life. Learn to know who is toxic and who isn’t and try to treat people the way you want to be treated. Most of us like it when others are empathetic. There are a smaller group who don’t.Learn to know whom you can trust. It doesn’t have to do with skin color, race or nationality. It has everything to do with what is inside them. Best wishes, E! ## He said, “Enjoy what time you have left.” I met this man on public transit and he had been trying for what felt like over an hour to get into my pants and I told him to leave me alone and that I wasn’t interested. I feel that he was embarrassed because one out of two of his friends had witnessed the extent of our verbal conversation. I’m thankful that nothing came of the situation but I had feared for my life and it all started with a man I never met before in my life but acted as if he knew me and wouldn’t leave me be until the time he did. May it be embarrassment or a higher power but I’m just glad that he left and didn’t follow when I got off the public transit spot."

Don’t you think the solution to this problem is disabling the comment sections of these social media platforms?","The most drastic solution to toxic comments is to disable the commenting system. But that would be like cutting off your nose to spite your face.The world is full of toxic people with toxic thoughts who are willing to spill their vitriol on any commenting system they come across.But just like Greta Thunberg’s mission, the world needs to be convinced that, just like climate extinction, writing toxic comments everywhere is not going to help anyone (let alone those who write them).Toxic breeds hate. Hate turns into violence. Just like those who have been brainwashed by ISIS, there needs to be some sort of mechanism in place to reverse this way of thinking.This won’t happen overnight, but it needs to happen soon. My suggestion is to either ignore toxic comments, or supersede them with positive ones. Try and get kind and helpful comments to swamp out the toxic ones.Start by replying with a comment that is the exact opposite. Spread some positive vibes. Most people would prefer to see a non-toxic comment, and may even be inclined to reply to voice their support.Turning off comments because of toxic contributions means the toxic people have won. Which is the last thing we want to let the world know… ## I have a seldom-used blog on the local newspaper site. it’s seldom used because the trolls often make nasty and inappropriate comments. This doesn’t usually happen on my blog site, even when THE CONTENT IS EXACTLY THE SAME. This has been a problem for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, et al, as well. They’ve required people to register and will yank uncivilized comments. But the latter takes the paid time of a staffer. So banning comments is an option, perhaps not a desirable one…"

This type of comment isn’t any good and can be hurtful to those who take it personally, but it doesn’t mean anything.But occasionally, someone will read something they just don’t agree with - maybe it challenges their beliefs - and then logic and human decency seem to vanish. All that matters is that they let you know how wrong you are and what a bad reflection this is on society. The comment becomes a rant and it will become even worse as someone will try to reason with the commenter or challenger their position and it just ends up in name-calling or something as equally pathetic.My point to all of this is if you don’t read the comments, you won’t notice any of this happening and it won’t be hurtful. Yes, it means you miss out on the good stuff too, but isn’t it worth it to avoid all of the bad?I do read the comments, but I very rarely respond to them. I don’t get hurt by such trivial things, but most people do. If they get hurt by words on a screen, then they shouldn’t be reading the comments. Actually, they shouldn’t open themselves up to get hurt through comments, but that’s a discussion for another day. ## In my mind this would be foolish. Comments provide feedback, and you will need to know if your posts are liked by your readers and they approve of what you have written.Also you will need to read your comments so you can answer them. This post explains why this is important."

You caused the problem. You have no right to complain.I, on the other hand, who did not vote — who did not even leave the house on Election Day — am in no way responsible for that these politicians have done and have every right to complain about the mess that *you* created. That *I* didn’t have anything to do with.Where do people think these politicians come from? They don’t fall out of the sky.

They are free to complain and bitch about how lousy government is. I want them to sound off.BUT- It is more effective to make your complaints known at the ballot box. It is more effective to go into that booth, and vote some scumbag out, than to just bitch about the scumbag.There is a maxim in law “Quietat es Consenteri”. which means “silence is consent”. People who do not vote, are consenting to the choices made by the people who do vote. ## I think you’re speaking of Quora commenting and voting.When I find an answer that isn’t bad enough to deserve a downvote, but clearly has either an incorrect fact or obvious logical hole, I won’t touch the upvote or downvote but I will still comment."

It is precise, but some times it is difficult to understand why the programmer took a particular approach. The algorithm could rely on the results of some previous calculations or provide results for some further piece of the program. Even if you read your own program later on, it is sometimes difficult to remember what you did to it exactly.Choosing right names of variables, functions and objects could help dramatically to understand the program and its statements. However, in some cases it might not be enough.As a result, an explanations in a plain spoken language can be very helpful. Those explanations are added to the program as comments.The other use of the comments is to provide unrelated information to the program, e.g. the name and email of the programmer, license information, …People also use comments to decorate the program so, that it is just easier to read, by adding separators.However, comments could also be unhelpful. In many cases I saw people add comments which actually describe the next code line in a bit different terms( e.g., /* this is a loop */, followed by the loop). This way it is just a space-taken unneeded comment which reduces readability of the program. ## A comment is some text that you put in a program to tell you or another person what something is about is the main use of comments but you can write anything in comments because they’re ignored by compilers."

On the other hand there are many blogs that are ranking well without comments section. It depends on the authority. The problem comes with the removal of the existing comments. Trust me, the user interactions always help your site to rank well. The downside of comments is spam. But, there are lot of plugins that fight the spam. By the way why do you like to remove the comment section. Keep them. ## The blog with with comment section is always better as the visitors can interact easily using comment. But for any reason if you want to remove the comment section of the blog, then it might affect the ranking if you have posts on your boog with good amount of comments on it.In a way it decreases the social signals and trust factor of your website if you removed already writeen comments by removing the comment section.But if there are no comments on blogs till now. then in my opinion in will not impact your raking in SERP. ## Short answer: Yes, it can reduce your chances to rank better.As a blog is made for people to react on other people’s thoughts and that’s why blogs do well on search engines.Commenting is the main source and spice of a blog and when you remove that, your dish (blog) will not be able to taste well.So, you should read How I Increased My Blog's Traffic by 83% in one Night and understand why this type of case studies are there.I recommend you to install an easy to use the commenting system and encourage more of your readers to leave their comments, engage with them and try to resolve their issues in the comment section.This will create a community on your blog and you will start noticing the actual growth in traffic and the revenue as well.Thanks! ## it may only if your comment section contains keyword- comment is more for conversion than traffic and ranking.

"/What-should-I-comment-on-code-What-how-or-why"," Comment (computer programming),  Computer Programmers,  Software Engineering,  Learning to Program,  Programming Languages,  Computer Programming","What should I comment on code? What, how, or why?","“What” should be immediately obvious from context and/or the name of the function, module, file, etc. There should (almost) never be a comment explaining what code does, or the meaning of a number or string. Meanings should be conveyed by the name of a symbolic constant. If the code is in a very strange problem domain that people might need help understanding, that would probably be better served by external documentation like a README file, not subject to the constraints of comments.“How” should generally be obvious from the code, but sometimes it’s a bit too complex for quick human understanding. There should rarely be a comment explaining how code works. Sometimes a very brief comment referring to a standard algorithm that you’re using, that might not be immediately obvious, can be helpful, such as writing a comment above a function named greatest_common_divisor noting that you’re using Euclid’s algorithm. If you find yourself tempted to write one, consider why how your code works is unclear, and see what you can do to fix that. Extracting a large chunk of code to a well-named function is one of my gotos, so to speak. Renaming a poorly named function, variable, or whatever, can also work wonders.That leaves “why”. These are generally acceptable. For instance, why do we have to do this weird thing at all, why are we doing this here instead of over there which might seem the obvious choice, why did we not do this the usual/obvious way, etc. Again, though, if you’re tempted to write a comment, think what you might be able to do to make it unnecessary. ## I mostly agree with Alan Mellor, in that I think his answer is the truth, and nothing but the truth…. but it’s not “the whole truth” as far as I’m concerned :-)We use comments to help “speed reading” of the code.We have a general policy of preferring early returns in objects to “else” clauses, but if you want to speed read the code, then it’s sometimes worth including lines that make it obvious where “in the flow” you are:...{Lots of previous code, so this wouldn't be line 1}... // If we get to here we haven't verified the password... {some code to run in this case} ...In most cases, we log API calls, but sometimes need exceptions. In this case, we want to make it clear that we’re not logging this call by intention rather than by oversight:// Not logging, because the logs store the parameters// which in this case include the new PWWe also like to make explicit the types of parameters to methods. In this case, the string needs to be in “SQL data difference” format:    /**     * Get pupil movement history for given period     * @param  {string} $period in format 1d, 5m, 2y for 1 day, 5 months, 2 years etc.     * @return {array}     */	public function getPupilMovementsHistory($period = '1d')    {	... code ...	} ## If you’re a professional developer, each company/project has a coding standard. One definition of a good dev is someone who complies with the coding standard, without complaint, even when they don’t like it. There are rare exceptions that involve extensive documentation, but obviously, that doesn’t apply here. Comply with the standard.If you’re in Java, make sure your JavaDoc is complete, and if it’s another language with a similar tool (e.g., Doxygen), then do that. Complete should include a brief description of each class, method, argument, and return value. Some judgment is usually called for; on a container, for an empty() method that returns a bool, you don’t need to repeat three times that it will return true if the container has no elements, and false otherwise.If you didn’t understand how to solve the problem before you wrote the code, document.If you are copying/modifying code from somewhere on the internet, don’t be an idiot; include the link. A Stack Overflow page will incorporate extensive discussion of why a particular solution should and shouldn’t be used. Don’t be embarrassed; we all use online resources.Outside of reviewed code, I’m not a fan of the “I write self-explanatory code” nonsense. Everyone thinks they do, but it’s Dunning-Kruger. If people are reviewing your code regularly, then it’s fine; they should comment on naming and other “self-documentation”.Most “self-documenting code” I’ve encountered is utter, utter crap. ## LESS IS MORE:I’m a strong proponent of using as few comments as possible.This is the opposite of what is drummed into beginning programmers - but I’ve been a highly successful working programmer for 45 years and I know what I’m talking about.Two “golden rules”:Only comment things that are not obvious from reading the code.Write code that makes things obvious without comments.Writing a comment is a sign of failure of rule #2…so before you type a comment think “Can I say this by clarifying the code? Renaming a function? Renaming a variable?”WHY?Good programmers can read code as easily as they can read English - so it’s stupid to write things twice - once in code and again in English.Every function should be short and for sure, fit comfortably within one screenfull (say around 50 lines - including useful whitespace and comments). Studies have shown that the statistical number of bugs in a function increases gradually with increasing length and jumps dramatically when you can’t see the entire function at a single glance (ie without scrolling it either laterally or vertically). Adding unnecessary comments means that you can’t have as much code or clarifying white-space within in a function without pushing it over that threshold - the conclusion of which is: Adding unnecessary comments causes bugs!Comments can be out of date - code is never out of date. So if you say something in a comment and then someone changes the code but forgets to change the comment - you have a comment that disagrees with the code - and no amount of testing or debugging will ever show that it’s wrong - and the lack of a comment change doesn’t show up in “diffs” - so they typically evade code reviews. If that happens and people are reliant on that comment to understand the code - then you’re running a huge risk of misleading them in the future - and that is a disaster!! If people aren’t reliant on the comment - then you didn’t need it in the first place. If there are no unnecessary comments then people are forced to read the code - and that is guaranteed to be a 100% true statement of what the computer will do with it.Encouraging excess commenting makes people lazy about writing legible code…forcing yourself to write code that doesn’t need comments is better than lazily writing crap and commenting the heck out of it.ALSO:Do not use comments to remove dead code - in languages that support “#ifdef” style directives or something similar, use #ifdef/#endif around it and add an #undef of the controlling token describing WHY the code is commented out. Otherwise, just delete the dead code.THAT SAID:DO use large block comments to explain big-picture algorithms. Why?The big-picture way something works is often hard to discern from code - even if the code itself is fairly self-explanatory.The big-picture algorithm is less likely to change and get outdated so these kinds of comments rarely mislead people.These block comments exist between functions/classes and not within them - so they don’t interfere with that “keep it under a screenfull” rule.DO use short comments for searchable things: like BUG, FIXME, HACK, TODO, UNDONE, XXX,DO use comments for Doxygen (or other auto-documentation tools like JavaDoc). Yes, this is unfortunate - but necessary. Remember that you are writing them for people who CAN’T see the actual code…but where a class/function/variable name already adequately explains the purpose - don’t write unnecessary text.DO explain things that are somehow tricky and NOT obvious from the code.DO NOT document bad code…fix it or file a bug report against it.IGNORE STUPID RULES (including all of these) if it makes things better. So (for example) if you’re a beginner programmer and you’re writing code only for yourself - feel free to explain things to yourself.If you are in some organization that has “company style rules” that mandate a certain ratio of comments to code or some equally horrible thing - find another job - you’re working for idiotsCONCLUSION:Less is more. ## My approach is to transform this:// stores the username of currently logged in user String s = ... code to get currently logged in user ... // fetches the usernames of allowed usersSet<String> a = ... more code ... // checks if user is allowedif ( a.contains(s) ) {  ... code ... }Into this:Users allowedUsers = new Users();allowedUsers.load(); String currentUser = getCurrentlyLoggedInUser(); if ( allowedUsers.contains( currentUser ) {  ... code ...}I find that by converting comments into variable, method, class names, you get all the benefits of comments but in a way that is less likely to go out of date.The resulting code has less duplication, less cognitive load ( ‘I must remember that variable a means allowed users’ ) and you cannot forget to update the comments that no longer exist. ## Alan Mellor's answer to What should I comment on code? What, how, or why? explained most of it.Yet you cannot always express design choices in the code itself.An example I recently encountered can be commented as follows/* Usually we use Macaulay duration to calculate the weighted average term to maturity of the cash flows from a bond.Yet in this instance we should use the Fisher-Weil duration and calculate on final maturity and not coupon reset because we are dealing with an interest rate swap contract which is used to adjust the portfolio duration and is not likely closed before maturity. Fisher-Weil generates better results for these long lasting contracts */ actualIRScalculationmethod(...)This prevents someone who only studied the textbooks to revert to the Macaulay duration and/or maturity on coupon reset without understanding the nuance.You can’t capture that easily in code. ## What should I comment on code? What, how, or why?You should not comment what you are doing. This should be apparent through the code itself, which can be achieved by keeping artifacts short and using speaking names for methods, classes and variables.You should comment why you are doing things that are not obvious, e.g. if you have to use a workaround because a dependency is not working as expected.Additionally it is common practice to comment classes and at least public fields and methods to be able to generate code documentation from it, e.g. by javadoc or Doxygen.I personally comment all classes, all methods and all fields. I almost never have any comments within a method’s body, though, use speaking names and keep methods to at most 30 lines of code, which already is an exception. If a method becomes longer than 10 lines I usually start to refactor. ## In my mind, commenting in code is almost obsolete.If you're writing code, your almost certainly working in a version control system.Every time you commit code you're entering a comment explaining the commit, and the version control system is taking the changes you've made.When you're reading code you can easily check the revision history of the code, line by line, and see which changes were made when, as a part of what commits.And for each commit you can see what else changed at the same time.If you've integrated your version control with your task management system, you can see, in the version history, which task each commit was as part of, which should link you to the requirements and acceptance criteria for each change.There is still a place for comments in code. Hints about how an external API works that is different from what is expected, etc.But mostly you should be working on creating meaningful commit messages, that describe what was done, and reference the task information that explains why. ## The answer given by Alan Mellor is a good one, and you should definitely do that, as it largely removes the need for the ‘what’-type comments. They can still be necessary if the code is doing something weird or complex (eg fast inverse square root), but in those cases you must be sure that it’s absolutely necessary to do it the weird complicated way; usually it’s better to rewrite the code to be more understandable.So, that leaves ‘how’ and ‘why’. Both of these types of comments should only be added if it’s not obvious from the code, but particularly in the case of ‘how’ you should, as with ‘what’, try to rewrite it so the code explains itself. Sometimes that’s not possible—maybe you’re working around a bug in an API, or are facing an unusual hardware limitation, and need to do something that looks wrong or unnecessarily convoluted. In that case, leave a comment explaining why you’re doing it, ideally with a URL that explains the problem in more detail. Maybe you’re referencing a variable defined in another file—it can be helpful to mention the file path, if it’s not standard for the framework you’re using. ## Alan Mellor has it right. A lot of commenting is completely unnecessary if you use descriptive variable and method names to communicate what the code is doing and what is intended to be stored.I use comments only in the following places:I decorate properties that can’t be named well to explain what they’re for or their intended values.I comment code that seems odd or is a weird way to accomplish something so that it’s clear why I went that route. For example, in an Angular app that stores report parameters in a dictionary in service, when you view a report it creates a new guid and copies those parameters to it. To any other developer it doesn’t seem useful - why, every time that you run a report, do you duplicate the parameters? It’s to support running the report again but with different values, so it pre-copies them for you so they can be changed and you can click Run again.Otherwise comments are pretty much non-existent. Rely on writing clear, concise, understandable code that anyone can jump into over commenting."

These lines are ignored by interpreter just like comments. Except that you will be able to see this using func.__doc__.So you can use this elsewhere also as simple multiline comments.If you assign it to a variable, it can also work as a multiline string.s = """"""Thisisamultilinestring""""""If you print s, it will be printed with all the newlines preserved. ## Python does support multiline comments , if you use‘’’‘’’this is the proper way to use a multiline comment in python3Also this is known as documentation, if you assign this to some variable this has a different problem !Tuhin Mitra ## “”“If you want to use multiple line Comments you should use triple quotes before and after the sentence”””"

Please, ensure that raffle is legal in your area and doesn’t need any procedures or approval,I hope, I helped! Thanks for the answer request M.Amine Mamine ! ## Hi M.Amine MamineThere is a platform called Iconosquare . It’s essentially an Instagram & Facebook Analytics Management Platform.Iconosquare's comment tracker is great for Instagram accounts that see a high level of interaction and when a user needs a clean, simple layout — ideally on a desktop computer — to properly manage comments. Although new comments show up in the activity tab on the Instagram app, they can get lost in the feed of likes and follows, making it easy to miss lots of them or lose track of the ones you need to reply to.The comment tracker will display a feed of your most recent thumbnail photos similar to how your Instagram profile looks. Here is where you can easily read and respond to comments that you may have missed while using the app, showing you all your unread comments on your most recent posts."

Wouldn't that seem a little odd? Well, to me it seems equally odd online.Now I realize this is just my personal view, so I try not to interpret upvotes as being intended in this manner. And I'm not writing comments to garner praise, so in a sense it doesn't even matter.But in terms my own actions, and because I see things in this way, I endeavour to reply to all supportive or reasonable comments, even if just with a “thank you”.To me there isn't this big divide between “real world” and “online existence” so however I would reply in person is how I will reply online also.And as such it makes sense that I prefer it when others do the same. But I'm not offended when they don't. People see things in different ways, and it's the intention that really matters - which, of course, we don't always know."

The answer is simple. As others have answered, any time that you copy someone else’s words without providing attribution as to the source, it is plagiarism. Period. Similarly, using someone else’s unique thoughts, ideas, analyses, theories, etc. without attribution can similarly be regarded as plagiarism.If you have any doubt whatsoever regarding whether or not it is plagiarism, simply citing the source *properly* will ensure that it is not plagiarized.With that said, “citing the source properly” means the appropriate use of quotation marks or a block quotation format so that it is clear that the wording is someone else’s and not your own.Finally, writing an academic paper consisting almost entirely of properly cited quotations may not be considered “plagiarism”, but that paper will not include sufficient original thought to be considered a scholarly work. ## I agree with other answers that the sheer number of “is ___ plagiarism” questions is, frankly, mind-numbing.Still, it’s a vital topic in today’s academic world. Back in my high school/college days, we had to go out of our way to copy something — first, look it up in the card catalog, then dig out the microfiche or paper version of the source, then write down exactly what the source said.These days, it’s easy — select, Copy, then Paste. Simple!Nothing wrong, then or now, with copying something someone else has written. In fact, it’s important to include credible sources (not sure I’d count a comment made in a comment section as credible, but I’m not looking at what you’re looking at either) to bolster whatever argument you’re trying to make.What’s considered plagiarism is to do so without citation. Using someone else’s words in your own academic writing is good academic work. Using it without clearly (according to whichever style manual your school uses) referencing it is stealing, though.So….no, not plagiarism if you properly cite it. Yes, is plagiarism is you do not. Simple, yes? ## Question: Is copying a comment made in a cpmment section to use for your paper consideted plagiarism?Answer: It is unclear in your question who actually made the comment. Was this comment made by the author in a published text or article?If so, in any literature published that you are citing in your paper, it must be referenced, otherwise, it may be considered as plagiarism.It is much harder to reference comments made by peer-rerviewers which is not published.Any verbal professional communication entered into and referred to in a piece of acadmic work should ideally be referenced as (per.com).Hope this helps. Best wishes. ## I really dislike the 50,000+ variations of this same question on Quora.Here is the thing about plagiarism and should be a rule-of-thumb. If you use any quote from any source, it is usually ok to do so if you give credit to whom the quote belongs. If you try to pass-it-off as your own original quote then that is plagiarism and a copyright infringement, especially if you plan to make money from that quote. ## If someone else writes something and you use it, give the original writer credit in your piece—in the text or in the works cited page. Do not waste time trying to figure out how to use someone else’s words without being guilty of plagiarism, just give them credit, and there is no problem. ## Why copy it without giving credit? Surely Chicago or MLA has a way to credit an internet commenter for inspiring you or making a salient point in your overall narrative. ## Are you the original author of the comment (or paper or sentence or idea)? Then yes, it is plagiarism if you don’t properly cite it. It’s really that simple."

My role was to chronicle much of the work, which involved writing multiple stories for the firm’s corporate communication pieces.It was not my practice to have anyone edit or proof my work, and that apostrophe error sneaked by me. (It wasn’t that I didn’t know better; it was that when one proofs one’s own work, there is a tendency to see what you know should be there.) I did not catch the error until it was too late to fix it and have the newsletter reprinted.Maybe I should comfort myself with the fact that grammar has lost importance in today’s world. It’s quite possible that anyone reading it years into the future will not notice.But it continues to haunt me that my name is on that piece, and the error will exist forever in a prominent story about Wisconsin’s most important landmark. ## While writing my book Whose Life Is It Anyway? Recognising and Surviving Domestic Violence, I screwed up and then my publisher’s editor did, missing the same details I did. It’s amazing how many mistakes in a book can be overlooked even after reading the manuscript a number of times. As my book is factual I had to change the names of the abuser and everyone else connected to him, his friends, family and the names of our children. I thought I’d been really careful about not leaving any real names in the book, however I had and despite the second edit by the editor, my daughter drew it to my attention that I’d left the abuser’s name and his mother’s real name on 3 different pages. The manuscript had gone in to publication so the book had to be recalled and revised copies made. Defamation is too common to risk using real names in autobiographies. ## Okay, so I’m not perfect and editors have picked up errors, but they are mainly typos rather than glaring mistakes.However, when I received the proofs of my memoir that was published by The History Press, I did, thankfully read the proofs and not just signed them off.In one passage I had recounted the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana’s engagement ball in the Guildhall, London. I’d written: “…the officers mess orderlies were the waiters…” The editor had decided the sentence needed a comma after ‘officers’, so the sentence read: “…the officers, mess orderlies were the waiters…”That sentence would have made a laughing stock out of myself and the publisher. I recommend to all authors that they check the proofs before publication with a fine-tooth-comb. ## ByronMost of the time, because my advice is do not depend on your eyes only to proof-read.Somehow you miss the mistakes.Repeatedly.So, to avoid screwing up get fresh new expert eyes to read your book/text.My latest book, alas, has mistakes I should have spotted, and also should have been spotted by one of my three editors. I don’t think there’s such a thing as the perfectly edited books, whether it’s misuse of parenthesis and brackets, orSo what happens is, you make corrections…and it is unending.My biggest mess was starting off the book (in the very first paragraph) saying the date of a famous murder was Sunday. I knew it was Sunday. I swore it was Sunday. But I was wrong. It was Saturday.Happy proofing days. ## I can remember a time I did not proofread that was as embarrassing as it was hilarious. I was working for portfolio managers at one of the largest companies in the world at the time. I was discussing an important matter. The note itself was fairly well constructed. Unfortunately, I signed the email by misspelling my name. Immediately upon sending it I got a response. A portfolio manager simply responded, “Yes, we understand, Eroc”. Oops. Misspelling one’s own name is never a good look. ## Oh BOY!!!Lots of times! I am Dyslexic. I have to STAFF or go to a professional secretarial service when a paper is important enough! Including in courses in college or my education.Some people are great at typing and spelling. But they lack the insite and ability to do what I do well!!! Lead, plan, spend our money well so that there IS a return, visualize, do the drafting and drawings for everyone to follow. Make a profit. Ride herd and keep everyone on target.Anything else??? ## No matter how often I read something I’ve written, my brain (ever so helpful) will see what I meant to say, not what I actually typed. So there are plenty of times I’ve missed obvious errors. That’s why editors and copyeditors exist, because we’re too close to the work to see the flaws. I can’t recall any specific really bad mistakes, but I know I’ve made plenty, and always will. A few still make it through despite me proofreading, two different editors, an independent proofreader … and often errors get introduced during the correction process. I’ve had proofreading changes fail to appear in the printed book, for instance. ## I think proofreading is part talent & training and part gift. I cannot do it. I can read my own stuff several times and still miss typos and such that I pick up on later. When I was publishing The Jokesmith, a comedy newsletter for business and professional speakers, I had a friend (a retired comic) proof it for me. He found numerous mistakes I had missed. I’ve never used any of the automated stuff, but a good proofreader makes a valuable contribution. ## There are two types of people:Those who achieve greatness and expertise (how they got it does not matter),Those who might not have been very bright or intelligent but worked their way up the incline; they just came up by following each rule that was taught to them.I am of the second type but have learnt the hard way that being methodical is the best strategy whether you are bright or not.In effect, knowing that there are five steps to a solution, I would try to avoid overconfidence by going one step at a time so that I am being methodical and do not make mistakes.My clients love me for that reason even though I charge in advance. ## Yes. That does happen with spell check when it has a mind of it’s own.But, I made a big mistake on a brochure and invitation my company printed for a large corporation years ago. I typed the wrong phone number. The telephone company had to intercept all the phone calls to redirect it the proper people. This company was introducing a new major recording system and the reception was to be held at a hotel in Waikiki.Needless to say, everybody was upset with me. I was lucky to still have my job because the people liked me. Thank God! ## “I believe I would be a good fit to the goals of your organization.”But, nooo……this is what Anushka sent in, PDF and all.“I believe I would be a goofy fit to the goals of your organization.” ## We were producing a publicity leaflet for our new school - a triptych style document, which included the sentence, “The new school will be open to boys and girls aged between the ages of 11 and 14.” I an four colleagues proofread the document, so imagine my horror when 1,000 leaflets were returned from the printers to read, “The new school will be open to boys and girls aged beween the ages of 11 and 14.” ## I was writing/editing a newsletter and wrote Congradulation instead of Congratulation. Probably no one would have noticed except this was the newsletter for our chapter STC (Society for Technical Communications) newsletter and boy did I hear about my error at the next STC meeting. ## All through primary, middle and secondary school.I’m orthographically challenged, and my only recourse back in the day was the dictionary. I have always loved the dictionary, but it sucks for finding words you don’t know how to spell. I submitted without proof reading because I didn’t know how to fix what I knew was wrong.It wasn’t until I had access to a word processor (one of half a dozen for an entire university campus) that I bothered. Very bad on me. ## The time I did a college essay on a man named Harry Enis. His adversary in life was a man named Enal Angus. So I did a auto correct to Harry Penis and Analangus…. ## Time and time and time again, by not proofreading myself. but especially not other’s with less emotional attachment to the subject proof read also."

For those who don’t…Software companies are keen on their code style. They even have management mercenaries to enforce the rules. StyleCop is one such evil avatar which will thwart any attempt at writing aesthetically beautiful code by imposing a set of ill thought out rules designed by faceless bureaucrats and enforced willy-nilly by the management of the week who never ever actually see the resulting code.They even dictate where and how your code should be commented. Rules such asA comment must be preceded by a blank line.A comment must not be followed by a blank line.A comment cannot appear next to the ‘else’ in an ‘if’ statement.There must be exactly one space between ‘//’ and the start of the comment.The list of such rules which may (or may not) be enforced is almost endless.So, to aid the poor programmer (who is attempting to write useful comments in sensible positions neatly dovetailing with the code), someone intelligent decided to invent quadruple slash comments which are exempt from such rules.Once again we may comment precisely where and how we like.I expect that new laws will in time be imposed on those ‘////’ comments and we will be forced to add even more slashes to avoid the attention of the authorities.I will not be around in the year 2119 but by then it is quite possible that ASCII code ‘2F’ (hex) will be the most commonly used character in code.Or maybe common sense will prevail. Yes… it is a possibility, no matter how remote.Well written comments are always useful and it doesn’t matter a jot if they have no line before, a line after, or a space or not here or there. What is useless are comments that have not been updated to reflect changes in code. Where are the ‘cops’ for that bullshit?Who knows what the future holds."

Not my finest hour. It’s not exactly professional to say things like dumb and stupid in a comment, but, professionals still get frustrated. Sometimes the bluntness is a communication tool; it gets the attention of the reader and transmits a clear warning.// hours spent trying to fix this: 18Also not quite professional. But again, I was trying to get the point across that the issue was very hard to fix and shouldn’t be attempted. (I think, actually, the two comments were one after the other)// f**king Internet Explorer doesn't use max-width correctlyFind me a web developer who hasn’t said that and I’ll show you a noob or a liar. That’s a common sentiment.Profanity sticks out. The lack of professionalism conveys the frustration the developer was feeling — which, again, informs us of the difficulty of the problem.But, for me at least, that’s the line. Being a little blunt and goofy is one thing. Dropping f-bombs is another. I understand the developer’s frustrations — but any person, developer or not, should be in enough control over their emotions to keep profanity out of code and commits.[Added]Why is profanity unprofessional?I realize from some comments that profanity doesn’t seem to be a big deal to others. That’s totally fair. It might have to do with the kind of work you do.I work for a dev shop; the code I write isn’t mine, it belongs to a client.

The most unprofessional comments are the ones that call out the work of other developers.// Todo: re-write this as async function because we're not  amateursThat’s maybe a mild exaggeration of something I’ve actually seen in code. Despite that it’s a comment in code, it’s not actually about the code — it’s about proving you’re better than the person who wrote it. If you’re comment isn’t about the code, it shouldn’t be in the code.Some developers naturally feel like they’re in a competition to prove they’re better than others, so their comments always have to be a subtle (or not so subtle) dig at someone else. They’re pushing someone else down so they can raise themselves up. It’s a self-esteem issue./* Mary doesn't know how to do named parameters so you have to send 15 arguments */I don’t think I’ve seen actual name-dropping in code — but the only reason a developer is doing this is because that developer absolutely thinks that HR should be reviewing pull requests. That has to be the reason. ## I see unprofessional comments falling primarily into 3 buckets.A comment left out of frustration for tools usedA comment belittling the efforts of another developerA comment to brighten someone’s day and have a laughThe first is often made up of the other two.“<Company> doesn’t seem to understand that browser windows are resizable, so we have to do <Workaround>”Kind of light hearted, but definitely at the expense of the devs who wrote the library. Still, not really the end of the world.The second is likely the most harmful.“Why tf is this referenced here? Get rid of this circular dependency shit.”Whoever wrote that is just flagrantly called out, and the author of the comment did nothing to catch it in review, nothing to help the developer grow with positive feedback, and certainly nothing to fix it.This type of person is unprofessional, so it kind of logically follows that they’d leave unprofessional code.Finally, there are things that we just kind of chuckle at. There’s the old anecdote of the dev who never left comments in their assembly work until reaching line 1770 or 1827, I forget, and leaves,“MOV AX, 723h ; R. I. P. L. V. B.”Huh? RIP Ludwig van Beethoven. Unprofessional? Yes. Legendary? I mean… Yeah…My personal favorite that I’ve personally experienced was from my old boss, who was just rad. It went something like:// There can be only oneprivate OurSingleton() {…} ## well some reasons could be:they ARE unprofessional.they feel a need to capture attention to something more than what someone else’s idea of a “professional” comment would do.They find something about the section of code that they either just wrote or just fixed particularly annoying.They aren’t happy with the “recommended/required” solution that was mandated and want to go on record that it was not their design…I (briefly) was employed by a small company that sold proprietary software. Notice I did not call them a “software company”, that would imply actual technical competency at multiple levels. As frightening as this was, they actually had created an accounting software suite for a niche market. There weren’t any actual accountants either.They had an extremely old, heavily duct taped old product, written in an old technology by the cheapest “programmers” they could find. It was not architecturally sound on any level. They did not want to invest in doing it right, just keep patching bugs and adding “features” as quickly as possible.The “office manager” ran things. Seriously, her main job was customer support, but because she had been there a long time, she was made office manager. This put her in charge of product development. With no actual accounting training other than helping customers enter data, and ZERO, and I mean ZERO computer skills, she was giving orders to the developers. And I mean ORDERS, she was an absolute ****. First order of business on any new issue was to assign fault and berate.Anyway, in my brief tenure there, theoretically as lead developer/architect, enjoyment was limited. Pretty much the only enjoyment was in reading the comments in the code by previous developers. They were pretty direct. Things like “I know this cannot possibly be correct but _____ had a shit fit and demanded I do it this way.” “This will really F*** things up, but the **** had to have her way.”She was a horribly annoying and overbearing person and this was their only way they felt they could state their case.It served as a warning to whoever was stuck with the task of actually fixing it to do it quietly and gently.It absolved the coder of the blame for the bad design.So yeah “unprofessional”, but not inappropriate. ## I think is just honesty.when a compiler, interpreter, or browsers just fails to do what its supposed to do and you get more than 4 hours trying to solve something that should never have happen because your code is flawless but the flaw is on the framework you are trying to use and you actually can only do a work around.I thin the unprofessional is not the one that wrote the comment but the one that created that framework. but as that is in most cases big companies you cannot do anything about it but just leave a comment.And in a state of frustration noone can expect your comment to be nice.so if anyone says.Microsoft sucks.linux is flawed.the stupid windows need me to hardcode this or anything similar, I do not find that truly unprofessional but just crude honesty.I truly wish someone for once asks any of the supposedly great persons like the owner of Microsoft. “what do you feel to seel so many programas and that none of them work as your marketing promisses?”or “what is your secret when working you use some other thing than windows taking in consideration it has so many bugs?”because actually everyone knows windows do not work correctly and it hangs up a lot but microsoft is still the biggest company on the market. (or at least not banckrupted as it should be if you base it on the quality of their products )and its not the only one.So i guess as most programmers can do nothing about all that facts, sometimes they are underpaid and forced to work on things they do not even care, when they find how to solve and comment they go a bit over the edge, I do not blame them.In fact if the comment make you understand to not remove something its even better because you will remember it far more. ## Well, believe it or not developers are people too and not robots so therefore they do things that any normal person would do. Supposedly one of the factors that was inhibiting Microsoft from releasing some of their source code to open source was the comments left by the developer teams.When you spend perhaps a couple days working on a small block of code of say around 6 to 10 lines you get really frustrated. Leaving a comment on your code after you got it to work can be satisfying, and funny to the developers that follow.Some people leave unprofessional comments just to leave a funny note for those that may stumble upon it in the future. It’s like a nice little hidden Easter egg that other developers can enjoy. Typically, there is no malice when these comments are left and many times the upper management is unaware or simply doesn’t care about them. ## “What is your definition of being a professional?”Let me repeat a little lesson my father gave me back around 1980.I was working in the same department of a bank as my father. I was in his office as he picked up a report, and after a quick glance laughed out loud. When I inquired what was so funny, he explained.Dad: “Do you remember that ‘Jorge’ guy that came for the job interview on Monday? “Me: “Yeah”...I hesitated, remembering the feeling that the guy didn’t really understand the deeper currents, and could only see the loop in front of him. And therefore would need a lot of couching. My father, as merciless as always , waited for me to give my opinion.“He did not really impress me.” I stated diplomatically.Dad: “Me neither, so in my comments I stated that I would qualify he at a mediocre guy at best, and I suggested ‘we put him on the back burner’”By ‘back burner’ my father meant put on hold but keep him warm in case we have to return to him. Sort of a worse case candidate.Me: “And that is funny?”Dad: “No, but your boss’ comment was. Underneath my ‘put him on the back burner’, John wrote ‘And turn up the heat!’. Looks like Jorge impressed John even less.”After laughing at my bosses comment, I realized I felt uncomfortable. Wasn’t business supposed to be professional? This seamed to be an irrelevant almost disrespectful comment. I had a feeling akin to sacrilegious profanity of serious business. So I asked my father about it.As always, his answer was goal orientated:“John’s and my job in this process is to evaluate the candidates and then express our evaluation in a clean succinct fashion that allows no misinterpretation during the final review. My comments, and especially those of John, leave no room for someone to misinterpret our opinions. Mixing our meaning with flowery words, and coaching them in polite, but ultimately senseless sentences, does not make the meaning clearer. And finally, adding a little humor to a boring and otherwise tedious task helps keep our frustration down and allows us to do the job better. And that is the definition of being professional. Right? ”So I ask you: “What is your definition of being a professional?” ## Developers are human and sometimes they have a bad experience. They sometimes leave a comment in the code (which is not displayed to users) about the event.This list is dedicated to all the software 	engineers out there…Starting from my favorite:// I dedicate all this code, all my work, to my wife, Darlene, who will // have to support me and our three children and the dog once it gets // released into the public.Here are a few more which I collected from Stackoverflow (they are 	not related to each other):/*** For the brave souls who get this far: You are the chosen ones,* the valiant knights of programming who toil away, without rest,* fixing our most awful code.

Call the police or something.// This code worked before, but my cat decided to take a trip across my keyboard...// Singleton object. Leave $me alone.private static $me;// need a coffee to fix th\ ## Good answers here.I’ll agree that it mostly has to do with frustration.It’s easy to be outside the situation and say “Hey, that’s unprofessional.” (which isn’t wrong…) but the comment is typically something valid and a caution to future developers working on that part of the project.Most developers I know (*all developers I know) have experienced frustration at working with third party APIs, inadequate tooling, etc… So when we see something like that, we understand why it was put there. Sometimes the language could be seen as ‘unprofessional’, but that really depends on the domain.I’d rather see a comment like/* This API is stupid because it doesn't accept standard JSON.   Don't change this unless you want to spend a couple days in troubleshooting hell because their damned API also doesn't give any usefull information on failures.*/than spend hours trying to troubleshoot simple changes I’ve made.Someone who has built a career pampering customers and tiptoeing around people’s feelings and HR politics may cringe in horror at something like that.Me? I’d giggle and thank the previous dev.That also brings to question: “What is unprofessional?”Any personal attacks, warranted or not, are unprofessional.There are also plenty of coding examples that have nothing to do with comments that are unprofessional and will cause reputational damage, but that’s not the question here.That depends on your organization, and who owns your codebase. If it’s something that’s publicly visible, IE - CSS or client JS, then comments like that would need to be toned down.If it’s owned by another company (like contract work) then it probably also needs to be toned down. (Maybe not? But I wouldn’t risk it.)If it’s internal? Get your direction and examples from your management team. ;) ## It depends on what you mean by unprofessional.Personally, I don’t see any reason for profanity in comments. A year now as a developer, I’ve seen small simple comments in plain English written in a way the developer would talk to me. This has been fine for me.If a developer leaves a comment like://This fucking loop stops at 96Then I’ll be a bit surprised. That comment could change to://This loop stops at 96. The reason is bla. I have tried bla but couldn't get it to work.The second version for me is fine. If one dev starts swearing and writing non-descriptive crap in comments I’ll end up with thousands of lines of code which at every function has the “F” word in it. I see this as unprofessional. Depends on the person though.Having said that, I think if somebody leaves an unprofessional comment as per above, it may be due to them trying to impress the readers? It may be because the developer likes swearing anyway? It may be because the developer had his wife calling him complaining about the dirty dishes at home at the time he was commenting code?The truth in the “Why” clearly lies in the developers character and mood at that moment in time.A2A. ## Multiple reasons, but not necessarily the ones you might at-first guess.For example, I think my favorite comment in C code was one I wrote many years ago, at the head of a security function that was tasked with keeping unauthorized people from accessing some data (I don’t recall the details). The comment went like this:/* Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed * in the dark inn-yard. * He tapped with his whip on the shutters, * but all was locked and barred. */int SecurityFunction (SecDat* data){   …etc…(Taken from the poem ""The Highwayman"" by Alfred Noyes.)Not very “professional”, no. But then, being “professional” 24/7 tends to make one bat-shit crazy, so wild-ass off-the-wall comments in code were actually quite common at the company I was working for at the time.Such comments served several purposes:Boredom busters.Cultural sharing.Establish feeling of awe and mystery.Make people smile and brighten their day.(Rarely) Take a jab at a fellow programmer regarding some bone-headed piece of code. ## First, you need to define what “professional” means. Personally I would have to say that a comment that deviates from your guidelines is unprofessional. The particular words used to emphasize the case don’t have a lot of bearing on professionalism, beyond the requirements of the coding guideline or standard in place.Comments stay in the code when there is inadequate review, uncontrolled releases, or lack of response to comments, or even incomplete design cycles.Occasionally, if the issue is not specific, and there is no referenced “code smell” or guideline, there may need to be a request to add a specific guideline to the company standard.Nothing should be a mystery in the comments in the code. Particularly if this is code in a regulated industry, Medical Devices, Avionics, or Military for instance, a detailed rationale for changes is required. A poorly defined rationale for a comment is a smoking gun for an auditor. Referencing specific problems against your coding standard, or requirements should be a clear and obvious standard.Calling the issue a “f***ing major bug” after that description isn’t unprofessional, although I prefer to have a prioritized list of key flag words to grep for. ## “Why do developers sometimes leave unprofessional comments in their code?”Depends on your definition of “unprofessional” …If the code contains comments, variable names or method names that contain cursing or something, or especially “commit messages” for tools like Git, that has a far deeper impact and is usually a sign of immaturity in the person who wrote it. Sometimes they’re borne of frustration and anger, but in my experience, more “mature” developers tend to be much more professional.Incidentally, there are several “bots” on Twitter that scrape Git commit messages for curse words and I show them to my students as examples of “what not to do”, because potential employers look at those messages, and they could disqualify you for a job based on those comments. ## I don’t often comment my code, but when I do it’s unprofessional.I’m a big believer in self-documenting code. Comments for the sake of comments is just silly. Comments that serve as documentation (/// in most IDEs) is okay if you’re building a library for somebody else to consume.During average development though the only times I leave comments are when there’s some kind of weird business case. For example I worked with a company that had a list that the user could pick from. In the background they required us to filter out items that didn’t align with their political beliefs without informing the user.That’s fine, it’s their prerogative but I left a comment along the lines of//This comment serves as a silent protest, I did not want to write this, but the business owns it. The compiler will listen as well as the product people did ## The simple answer is that it’s something they would say in a private conversation with other developers, and they never expect anyone else to read those comments. That’s an unrealistic expectation, but it’s common enough.Unprofessional covers a rather broad range. At the extreme end, it would include profanity and personal attacks on other people involved in the project. Most of the developers I know don’t do that.At the other end, comments like// Fixed thiswould be unprofessional because they don’t convey useful information to anyone other than their author, and even then not for very long. However, it’s common enough to leave breadcrumbs around as a reminder of things that need fixing, or the extent of the changes required for something. The later is less common with modern source control tools that make it very easy to see all of the changes in a commit. ## Professionalism is a matter of perspective and largely based on personal opinion. It’s like social expectations, changes from area to area. And has a lot to do with how someone was educated, how they grew up, where they grew up and so on.In some companies, teams form a sort of camaraderie, and are really loose with each other, not rigid emotionless ethical robots.Maybe they’re inside jokes, maybe it’s structured criticism. Etc.Who knows, there’s a million reasons why someone might do it and it might be ok and it might not be ok. You’d really have to illustrate an example, and give back story on all the employees to decide if it was acceptable or not. ## Programming is usually very abstract. When you’re ‘in the zone’ (experiencing flow), being professional and proper isn’t on your mind - at all.You might have a thought that makes you chuckle a bit and put it in a comment, because why not.You might also be very frustrated with a project/particular piece of code/requirement you think is stupid and vent some of that frustration in a comment.“Programmer humour” is not something web-comics invented - it’s kind of a part of the process, and sometimes you don’t think about restraining yourself. ## Software graffiti?Most code in reality never sees the light of day, so the comments become more a log of frustrations of the development process. ## Essentially because we're human too- contrary to what other departments think. A lot of times it's fueled by frustration. There's a section of code that is poorly written and we are forced to work around it. We then have to do stupid things against our will to accommodate. It's not easy to remain neutral when writing in this context, knowing people could think the awful idea was yours.Other times very funny opportunities arise and we want to drop something hilarious in. It's hard to resist temptation sometimes, but professionals should. Smaller teams in more casual environments are able to get away with more. There's never a valid excuse for it if one is developing for an employer. Hobbyists can do whatever they like. ## Well comments are not code. and many places have ways to address how it should be used. Many business mite have where comments just tell what the purpose is. or What was fixed or found not to be an issues. If you are writing a small program. where only a few lines. adding comments are not need. but as tiger it gets the more you need. Just find away around. Some times comments are used to hid the code that was written. to see if that the issues. along with that some times variable names or ideas are add. example could be date tried x to fix issues.. did work or renamed They're is no law to follow. ## Frustration overriding professionalism usually. Just the other day I received a code review for the removal of the F-bomb from an Ansible playbook because this playbook was about to end up in the hands of a large client. I happened to agree with the comment's original text, but professional: it was not.Sometimes you might also find a passive-agressive jab aimed at another co-worker, so long as there's no genuine animosity, this is all in good fun. Still, not very professional and the truth is, you really can't know whose hands the source will be in in 5–10 years time. So please folks, stick to the facts. ## I never have and I've never seen any unprofessional code comments, I've seen comments that may come across as offensive to some but never anything unprofessional and we can't stigmatise all developers just because one or two can come across as assholes…. On the other hand if its custom code written for you or your company that has unprofessional comments then you've probably pissed or ripped the developer off, not saying you have but that's the only way I could imagine it would happen…. I have a set group of clients I write custom code for every few months and the often “forget” to pay me, so I leave reminders for them in the code which may be deemed unprofessional by some, but it's not… not paying me is unprofessional ## /* because it’s fun to do */ ## “Why do developers sometimes leave unprofessional comments in their code?”Only unprofessional ones do, in unprofessional organizations that do not have a proper quality system with mandatory code reviews.When coders complain in comments about the quality of the framework, operating system, hardware, other tools, I find mostly pathetic. Report the issue, implement some workaround, explain the issue and the workaround in a comment, and that’s it!It’s OK to be funny, and there are real gems in the genre of comments. Unfortunately 99% is less enjoyable. ## From what I’ve gathered, both frustration at programming being difficult and confidence that normal people won’t be seeing it (well, except for recent years). ## Ego, Attitude, just for the hell of it. Or maybe they had a bad day and were pissed off and this was the closest they could get to revenge. ## Because clients are often even more so. Unfortunate but true. Often a client will want it such and such a way and nothing will change their I d, I've built sits that I put in the comments it was the designs of the client I was Lmoag too embarresed to show it on. CV ## Professional code is not always pretty. It may be a short term hack or a legacy bug that is now enshrined in user expectations. Most developers are brutally self-honest when it comes to code that shouldn’t be there but has to be there. ## Well, because we are bored and that's one of the very fun thing to do as a developer! The beauty of it is, the only few person gonna interact with your code is the next person taking over your code, and your direct technical supervisor reviewing your code.These 'unprofessional' comments normally felt like it's talking to you directly. At least I like to comment them in a very first person manner. ## After one has been up for 3 days straight tying to locate the cause of an intermittent corruption of database records which ultimately turns out to be a race condition in an obscure module which worked just fine as long as the database server was located on the same host as the application web server, but only manifest when the application was scaled up to multiple web servers and a separate database server, one will no longer ask such a foolish question of a testy programmer. ## Define “unprofessional”. Code comments are there to inform and sometimes remind. There is no formality attached to them unless the coder's employer insists on it. ## Because we are all human beings and emotions sometimes get the upper hand.Comments are useful to convey both joy and frustration about a method of fix.20180625 - seriously, call me stupid but this just refuses to work. I'm going to get a stiff drink and try to forget about this sh*t20180626 - Who's the man! Don't you just hate it when you use = instead of == ... yeah, I know. I'll quit my day job soon.Is it unprofessional? Yes.Will you find a developer who's never made a comment like that? No."

"/Is-there-a-method-for-differentiating-informative-comments-from-commented-out-code-1"," Comment Systems,  Comment (computer programming),  Comments,  Computer Programming","Is there a method for differentiating informative comments from commented out code?","Yes. For any comment you suspect of containing code: generate a string containing the content of the comment (stripping leading/trailing /* // */ * etc.), and then apply a real substring parser for the langauge grammar to the remaining string. If it says “is a substring” then you have a comment containing code.If not, … well, you’ll have to decided how many syntax errors you will accept and still declare the comment contains code. With a substring parser you do this by repeatedly calling the substring parser on remaining pieces of the suspected code string. What you’ll see is an alternating sequence of “yes, that’s a substring <up to this point>” or “no (syntax error), not a substring, skipping nonsense characters”.Your real problem is finding/building a parser that can parse arbitrary substrings of the language; most parsers are entire-program-or-nothing. The more sophisticated the language (e.g., C++) the harder it is to do this. It isn’t easy to bend conventional parsers to do this.See our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit for a program analysis/transformation. DMS’s parsing machinery has an option to do substring recognition."

They may have a logical reason for their features, or they just do it because of personal interest.Instagram is one of them that we all know it for a long time; there is no blog or news about why they don’t let users copy a comment. So it may just have a personal reason, which is not really important. Because people can type the caption or comment, they want."
