<p>For example, in HTML</p>

<pre></pre>

<p>in this case, the outer comment ends on the first  instead of the corresponding last one, causing the last  to print, when it shouldn't.</p>

<p>The same happens for languages that use  for block comments, like in java, php, css, javascript, etc.</p>

<p>But my question is WHY is it that way? Why, by design, it is not allowed? I mention ""by design"" because I really doubt it is because of parsing problems, I guess the parsers are perfectly capable of keeping track of opening s and close the comments with their corresponding closing s But they simply somehow decided it is not a good idea.</p>

<p>I already know that a workaround for this is to somehow change the inner closing comments, to avoid them to close , and only leave the last closing one. e.g. changing inner s and s for s and s .

in this case, the outer comment ends on the first  instead of the corresponding last one, causing the last  to print, when it shouldn't.

The same happens for languages that use  for block comments, like in java, php, css, javascript, etc.

Is this what that piece code should be doing? I would really appreciate if someone could give a clear explanation, and then add some good examples (bad examples are not really needed, but fell free to add them for contrast).

Please do not immediately close this question as duplicate or polemic. I have tried hard to make it very objective. There are many questions on whether comments are good or bad, but no one that addresses the specific question of what are good examples of comments that tell you WHY.

Thanks,

<p>More specifically, is it considered best to put every constant in the top of the class, or to group them up in the area of the class where they are useful, and group the commons at the top?</p>

<p>By putting everything in the top, it seems to me that this might be easier to find everything you're looking for at the same place, but it can get overwhelming if this area is getting bigger:</p>

<pre></pre>

<p>By grouping them up, it makes more sense to the constants that are only used in specific areas of the class, but it may break the nice <em>symmetrical</em> effect grouping by types adds to a class, and might make it look <em>messy</em>:</p>

<p>Output:</p>

By putting everything in the top, it seems to me that this might be easier to find everything you're looking for at the same place, but it can get overwhelming if this area is getting bigger:



By grouping them up, it makes more sense to the constants that are only used in specific areas of the class, but it may break the nice symmetrical effect grouping by types adds to a class, and might make it look messy:

This means we have an entire library of dictionary classes designed to bit-shift object input data to/from the message binary representation. This library is reasonably large, and because the protocol is still young, has the tendency to be tweaked and changed every year or so.</p>

<p>The JavaDoc for this library provides ASCII art tables and diagrams that explain what a particular method expects as input (or output). These tables are exceedingly important because finding the documentation and verifying that the method actually does what the document says can be time consuming a prone to error. Following a single, simple ASCII-representation of the bit shifting makes this a lot easier.</p>

<p>I have a coworker who insists that ASCII art does not belong in JavaDoc (even with  tags), and furthermore that we configure Eclipse to automatically format the code on save. He offers two options to reformat the documentation: </p>

<ol>
<li>Embed an image.</li>
<li>Use an HTML table.</li>
</ol>

<p>The image would be okay, except Eclipse doesn't render SVG images. It is completely unacceptable to me that we maintain an SVG image and then export the image as PNG to our documentation repo, and then link the PNG with HTML. The amount of maintenance involved in that scenario seems completely crazy. Who is responsible for making sure all the PNG, SVG, and code are synchronized?? Furthermore, obviously, the data won't be readable without the image.</p>

<p>The HTML table option is bad for two reasons. First, the Eclipse formatter puts <em>each tag and value on it's own line</em>, which means every single value takes up three lines. It leaves huge gaps in the source code, and is completely unreadable without rendering the HTML. To make matters worse, some of our tables are complex, and troubleshooting HTML tables is not my idea of a responsible thing to require of developers who already resist creating documentation.</p>

<p>So if my coworker is right about ""java people"" not using ASCII diagrams for documentation, what is a standard, industry practice, that gives us a method for preserving these diagrams? How does this method benefit over using  tags with ASCII diagrams? Bonus points if you can answer why JavaDoc hasn't evolved to provide readable markup, instead of relying on HTML.</p>

('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; 'T list -&gt; int


ie, something that counts how many items of a list that a function returns true for. (or returns the index of the first item that returns true)

I used to use the big list at the MSR site for F# before the documentation on MSDN was ready. I could just search the page for the above text because the types were listed. But now the MSDN documentation only lists types on the individual pages--the module page is a mush of descriptive text. Google kinda-sorta works, but it can't help with

// compatible interfaces
('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; Seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; int
// argument-swaps
Seq&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; ('T -&gt; bool) -&gt; int
// type-variable names
('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; Seq&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; int
// wrappers
('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; option&lt;int&gt;

Haskell has a standalone program for this called Hoogle. Does F# have an equivalent, like Fing or something?

Question

How to document it elegantly? (cute &amp;&amp; concise &amp;&amp; no additional CPU cost)      

Example

Here is a simplified code:-
 (The real world problem is scattering around 10+ library-files &amp; 20+ user files &amp; 40+ functions.)

Library.h  

template&lt;class T&gt; class Library{
    public: T* node=nullptr;
    public: void utility(){
        node-&gt;func();  //#1
    }
};


User.h

class User{
    public: void func(){/** some code*/} //#1
    //... a lot of other functions  ...
    // some of them are also callback of other libraries
};


main.cpp

int main(){
    Library&lt;User&gt; li; .... ;  li.utility();
}


My poor solutions

1. Comment / doc

As the first workaround, I tend to add a comment like this:-

class User{ 
    /** This function is for ""Library"" callback */
    public: void func(){/** some code*/}
};


But it gets dirty pretty fast - I have to add it to every ""func"" in every class.

2. Rename the ""func()""

In real case, I tend to prefix function name like this:-

class User{ 
    public: void LIBRARY_func(){/** some code*/}
};


It is very noticeable, but the function name is now very longer.
(especially when Library-class has longer class name)

3. Virtual class with ""func()=0""

I am considering to create an abstract class as interface for the callback.

class LibraryCallback{ 
    public: virtual void func()=0;
};
class User : public LibraryCallback{ 
    public: virtual void func(){/** some code*/}
};


It provides feeling that func() is for something-quite-external. :)
However, I have to sacrifice virtual-calling cost (v-table).
In performance-critical cases, I can't afford it.
